Do you need a list of universities and their domain names? You found it! 

This package includes a JSON file that contains domains, names and countries of most of the universities of the world.
 - You can create a validation script that checks the email domain. 
 - You can automatically generate a user's country and university by looking at their emails.


You can use this data source in three ways:
 - Use the JSON file as your data source and do whatever you like with your favourite programming language.
 - Use free hosted-API.
 - Use the tiny Python app to serve a fast API that you can query data.


### 1 - Using the Data Source

The whole data source is located in the `world_universities_and_domains.json` file. It is just a list of dictionaries in the following format:

	[
		...
		{
		    ""alpha_two_code"": ""TR"",
		    ""country"": ""Turkey"",
		    ""domain"": ""sabanciuniv.edu.tr"",
		    ""name"": ""Sabanci University"",
		    ""web_page"": ""http://www.sabanciuniv.edu.tr/""
		},
		...
	]


NOTE: Some universities use a format like `[user]@[department].[domain]`, but this list only contains the `[domain]` portion. 
For example, an email address might be `[student]@cs.usc.edu`, and this list will contain 'usc.edu', the domain for the 
University of Southern California. Take this into consideration if using this list for email address validation.

### 2 - Using Hosted API

This is the easiest method if you're making a small project or just want to discover the data without any hassle.
It is sponsored by [Hipo](http://www.hipolabs.com) and free. If you have a big project, please host it on your own server.

Some example searches:

 - http://universities.hipolabs.com
 - http://universities.hipolabs.com/search?name=middle
 - http://universities.hipolabs.com/search?name=middle&country=turkey

The hosted API uses [university-domains-list-api](https://github.com/Hipo/university-domains-list-api) package.


### 3 - Using the built-in API on your server

You can access the python API via [university-domains-list-api](https://github.com/Hipo/university-domains-list-api)

# Contribution
Please contribute to this list! We need your support to keep this list up-to-date.

The Big List of Naughty Strings is an evolving list of strings which have a high probability of causing issues when used as user-input data. This is intended for use in helping both automated and manual QA testing; useful for whenever your QA engineer [walks into a bar](http://www.sempf.net/post/On-Testing1.aspx).

## Why Test Naughty Strings?

Even multi-billion dollar companies with huge amounts of automated testing can't find every bad input. For example, look at what happens when you try to Tweet a [zero-width space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-width_space) (U+200B) on Twitter:

![](http://i.imgur.com/HyDg2eV.gif)

Although this is not a malicious error, and typical users aren't Tweeting weird unicode, an ""internal server error"" for unexpected input is never a positive experience for the user, and may in fact be a symptom of deeper string-validation issues. The Big List of Naughty Strings is intended to help reveal such issues.

## Usage

`blns.txt` consists of newline-delimited strings and comments which are preceded with `#`. The comments divide the strings into sections for easy manual reading and copy/pasting into input forms. For those who want to access the strings programmatically, a `blns.json` file is provided containing an array with all the comments stripped out (the `scripts` folder contains a Python script used to generate the `blns.json`).

## Contributions

Feel free to send a pull request to add more strings, or additional sections. However, please do not send pull requests with very-long strings (255+ characters), as that makes the list much more difficult to view.

Likewise, please do not send pull requests which compromise *manual usability of the file*. This includes the [EICAR test string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EICAR_test_file), which can cause the file to be flagged by antivirus scanners, and files which alter the encoding of `blns.txt`. Also, do not send a null character (U+0000) string, as it [changes the file format on GitHub to binary](http://stackoverflow.com/a/19723302) and renders it unreadable in pull requests. Finally, when adding or removing a string please update all files when you perform a pull request.

## Disclaimer

The Big List of Naughty Strings is intended to be used *for software you own and manage*. Some of the Naughty Strings can indicate security vulnerabilities, and as a result using such strings with third-party software may be a crime. The maintainer is not responsible for any negative actions that result from the use of the list.

##About

This GitHub repository is maintained by the [NASA OCIO Open Innovation Team](http://open.nasa.gov/about/) and contains a catalog of publicly available NASA open source projects that are published on [code.nasa.gov](http://code.nasa.gov). The catalog is persisted as a JSON file ```catalog.json``` and contains an array of projects.  As Code Sharing at NASA is a community effort, we encourage NASA developers to add a meta-record in to this catalog to publish their open source projects on [code.nasa.gov](http://code.nasa.gov/).

##Requirements
* Open Source software project approved for open source release by your [NASA Field Center SRA](http://code.nasa.gov/#/guide)
* Code Project hosted in a code repository (preferably GitHub.com) and visible to Internet Users
* Meta record of your software project; instantiate ```required_fields_project_template.json```

## Add your project

* Create a project meta-record using the template from file required_fields_project_template.json:
  * Note that Category labels longer than 24 characters will be truncated.

Have you been itching to try that new data visualization library you saw on Hacker News? Do you enjoy data science or frontend development? Looking for a weekend project to hone your skills? Localytics is hosting a challenge with prizes to help bolster the data visualization community.

Given some analytics data, you'll create a visualization for BootLoader, a fictional crowdfunding mobile app, to help determine what segment of users would be interested in a new bicycle project. Read on for more details, and don't forget to checkout out our promotion site at http://data-viz-challenge.localytics.com

## Your task

BootLoader is a mobile app that helps people crowdfund their creative projects. Anyone with an idea, dream, and 2-minute video can post their project on BootLoader. Others then donate money to the project to help bring it to fruition.

Dennis Ridesalot, a BootLoader user, has a new concept for a 3-speed bicycle made from recycled parts with a $20 price point. The BootLoader team wants to send a push notification to their users, prompting them to fund the project. However, they don't want to send a message to all of their users--only those who they think would be interested.

That's where you come in. You're the resident data expert at BootLoader. You'd like to create a visualization that helps answer: what kinds of users would be interested in the bicycle project?

Luckily, you've been collecting analytics data on how your users fund projects. You also have software that can send push notification to segments of users, based on attributes like location, age range, gender, and mobile device.

For example, you can send a push notification to all iOS users in Chicago, IL that says ""Deep dish lovers unite! Help fund the largest pizza in the world on BootLoader.""

## The Data

Your analytics software tracks the events: ""View Project"" and ""Fund Project,"" for when a user views details about a project and for when they fund a project. The events also have the following attributes:
* `category`: what the project is about, e.g. ""Sports"", ""Fashion"", ""Technology"", etc.
* `client_time`: a UNIX timestamp of when the event occurred.
* `amount`: how much the user donated (for ""Fund Project"" only)

*Note:* The bicycle project belongs to two categories: ""Sports"" and ""Environment.""

Additionally, you know some information about each user on your site, that they supplied in a survey when they signed up. Specifically, you know:

* `session_id`: unique identifier for each user
* `age range`: one of ['18-24', '25-34', '35-44', '45-54', '55+']
* `gender`: one of ['M', 'F', 'U']
* `location`:
 * `city`: a city in the United States
 * `state`: a state in the United States
 * `latitude`
 * `longitude`
* `marital_status`: one of ['single', 'married']
* `device`: one of ['iOS', 'android']

From past experiments, you know that each user generally likes projects from the same category. For example, User A almost always views and funds projects from the ""Technology"" category. The bicycle project belongs to two categories: ""Sports"" and ""Environment.""

You have a sampled time series of 50,000 events from one month this year in a JSON blob. User data is added into every event. Note that BootLoader has more users than are represented by this sample.

Here's an example of two events by the same user:

    {
      ""event_name"": ""View Project"",
      ""gender"": ""M"",
      ""marital_status"": ""single"",
      ""session_id"": ""98ccfbe8c29845c0a44f8e56213d1def"",
      ""device"": ""android"",
      ""category"": ""Technology"",
      ""age"": ""25-34"",
      ""client_time"": 1393632024,
      ""location"": {
        ""latitude"": 33.786594,
        ""city"": ""Covina"",
        ""state"": ""CA"",
        ""longitude"": -118.298662,
        ""zip_code"": ""91723""
      }
    }

    {
      ""event_name"": ""Fund Project"",
      ""gender"": ""M"",
      ""marital_status"": ""single"",
      ""session_id"": ""98ccfbe8c29845c0a44f8e56213d1def"",
      ""device"": ""android"",
      ""amount"": 20,
      ""category"": ""Technology"",
      ""age"": ""25-34"",
      ""client_time"": 1393632301,
      ""location"": {
        ""latitude"": 33.786594,
        ""city"": ""Covina"",
        ""state"": ""CA"",
        ""longitude"": -118.298662,
        ""zip_code"": ""91723""
      }
    }

## Your submission

Once again, you want to create a visualization that answers: what segments of users would be interested in the bicycle project? Based on your visualization, BootLoader would send a push notification to those segments that advertises the bicycle project.

You can create any kind of visualization that you think best answers the question. e.g. static or interactive, using HTML5 or python. Feel free to use any tools you're familiar with, or try out that new data viz library you heard so much about.

To submit your visualization, star and fork the data viz challenge repo on Github here https://github.com/localytics/data-viz-challenge. This github repository also contains the JSON data. Submit a pull request when your submission is ready with some instructions on how to run your code or a link to a hosted version. Submit an issue on Github with any questions you have, or email dthompson@localytics.com.

While our prize pool challenge ended December 1st, 2014, feel free to continue submissions, as Localytics is always looking for new talents and ideas in the field of data viz. If you'd like to see our winner, feel free to take a look here at http://domajno.github.io/data-viz-challenge/

This repo contains a set of **31,030** Arabic newspaper articles alongwith metadata, extracted from various online Saudi newspapers.

File Structure
--------------
The folder `dataset` contains a set of ZIP files, where each file has the format `YYYY-MM-DD.zip` and contains one JSON file with a corresponding name `YYYY-MM-DD.json`. The JSON files are stored in UTF-8 encoding.

Each JSON file contains an array of articles (the format of each article is explained in the next section), and its file name reflects the date on which the contained articles were extracted.

Article JSON Object Format
--------------------------
The JSON object for each article contains the following fields (some fileds can have empty values in case the crawler failed to extract them):

 - **`source`**: A string identifief of the newspaper from which the article was extracted. It can have one of the following values:

#### A PornHub images meta-data dataset

`hub-db` is a dataset of information about albums in the adult website [PornHub](pornhub.com). This application crawls through the 'most viewed' search pages (which pages are defined in the [`config.json`](config.json) file) and recursively crawls all albums on those pages, and the images from those albums. No images are saved, but links to the images as well as tag metadata, upload timestamp, comments, etc. are saved.

This repository includes both the code to crawl PornHub to get this data as well as the dataset itself (when crawling is done).

### JSON Data Structure

Below is the structure for the json, which is dumped by BasePage into separate files. These files can be then combined to form whatever smaller and more specific dataset you want.

Example JSON dumps can be found in [`data`](data/), along with the actual dataset fully compiled.

```go
// BasePage corresponds to the most viewed
// photos page at a given page number
type BasePage struct {
	URI    string  `json:""uri""`
	Page   uint64  `json:""page""`
	Albums []Album `json:""albums""`
}

// Album corresponds to a image album
type Album struct {
	Title          string  `json:""title""`
	URI            string  `json:""URI""`
	Votes          uint64  `json:""votes""`
	UpvotePercent  float64 `json:""upvote_percent,omitempty""`
	Views          uint64  `json:""views""`
	Segment        string  `json:""segment""`
	Tags           []Tag   `json:""tags""`
	NumberOfImages uint64  `json:""num_images""`
	Images         []Image `json:""images""`
}

// Image corresponds to the data structure
// of image metadata pulled from PornHub.
// It references popular comments and tags,
// as well as general info about popularity.
type Image struct {
	Timestamp        time.Time `json:""timestamp,omitempty""`
	URI              string    `json:""uri,omitempty""`
	Votes            uint64    `json:""votes""`
	UpvotePercent    float64   `json:""upvote_percent,omitempty""`
	Views            uint64    `json:""vites""`
	NumberOfComments uint64    `json:""num_comments""`
	PopularComments  []Comment `json:""popular_comments,omitempty""`
	Tags             []Tag     `json:""tags,omitempty""`
}

// Comment corresponds to the data structure
// for a PornHub image comment. It contains simple
// information about the comments. To not reveal
// too much info about casual users their actual
// profiles aren't crawled
type Comment struct {
	Username   string `json:""username,omitempty""`
	NetUpvotes uint64 `json:""net_upvotes""`
	Text       string `json:""text""`
}

// Tag corresponds to generic information about
// tags (just the name currently to save space)
type Tag string
```

## Data

Data comes from multiple sources as follows:

Customary English short names are from
[Unicode Common Locale Data Repository (CLDR) Project] (https://github.com/unicode-cldr/cldr-localenames-full/blob/master/main/en/territories.json)
Note: CLDR shorter names ""ZZ-alt-short"" are used when available

ISO 3166 official English and French short names are from
[United Nations Statistics Division](http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49.htm)

ISO 4217 currency codes are from
[currency-iso.org](http://www.currency-iso.org/en/home/tables/table-a1.html)

Many other country codes are from
[statoids.com](http://www.statoids.com/wab.html)

Special thanks to Gwillim Law for his excellent
[statoids.com](http://www.statoids.com) site (some of the field descriptions
are excerpted from his site), which is more up-to-date than most similar
resources and is much easier to scrape than multiple Wikipedia pages.

Capital cities, languages, continents, TLDs, and geonameid are from [geonames.org](http://download.geonames.org/export/dump/countryInfo.txt)

EDGAR codes are from [sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/edgarstatecodes.htm)


## Preparation

This package includes Python scripts to fetch current country information
and output a JSON document and CSV of combined country code information.

CSV output is provided via the `in2csv` and `csvcut` utilities from [csvkit](http://github.com/onyxfish/csvkit)

### data/country-codes.csv

Install requirements:

    pip install -r scripts/requirements.pip


Run GNU Make to generate data file:

    make country-codes.csv

## License

This material is licensed by its maintainers under the Public Domain Dedication
and License.

Nevertheless, it should be noted that this material is ultimately sourced from
ISO and other standards bodies and their rights and licensing policies are somewhat
unclear. As this is a short, simple database of facts there is a strong argument
that no rights can subsist in this collection. However, ISO state on [their
site](http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/country_codes.htm):

> ISO makes the list of alpha-2 country codes available for internal use and
> non-commercial purposes free of charge.

This carries the implication (though not spelled out) that other uses are not
permitted and that, therefore, there may be rights preventing further general
use and reuse.

If you intended to use these data in a public or commercial product, please

## Data

The data is extracted from [geonames][geonames], a very exhaustive list of worldwide toponyms.

This [datapackage][datapackage] only list cities above 15,000 inhabitants. Each city is associated with its 
country and subcountry to reduce the number of ambiguities. Subcountry can be the name of a state (eg in 
United Kingdom or the United States of America) or the major administrative section (eg ''region'' in France''). 
See ``admin1`` field on [geonames website][geonames] for further info about subcountry.

Notice that :
* some cities like *Vatican city* or *Singapore* are a whole state so they don't belong to any subcountry. Therefore subcountry is ``N/A``.
* There is no guaranty that a city has a unique name in a country and subcountry (At the time of writing, there are about 60 ambiguities). But for each city, 
the source data primary key ``geonameid`` is provided.

## Data

From the [VIX FAQ][faq]:

> In 1993, the Chicago Board Options Exchange® (CBOE®) introduced the CBOE
> Volatility Index®, VIX®, and it quickly became the benchmark for stock market
> volatility. It is widely followed and has been cited in hundreds of news
> articles in the Wall Street Journal, Barron's and other leading financial
> publications. Since volatility often signifies financial turmoil, VIX is
> often referred to as the ""investor fear gauge"".
>
> VIX measures market expectation of near term volatility conveyed by stock
> index option prices. The original VIX was constructed using the implied
> volatilities of eight different OEX option series so that, at any given time,
> it represented the implied volatility of a hypothetical at-the-money OEX
> option with exactly 30 days to expiration.
> 
> The New VIX still measures the market's expectation of 30-day volatility, but
> in a way that conforms to the latest thinking and research among industry
> practitioners. The New VIX is based on S&P 500 index option prices and
> incorporates information from the volatility ""skew"" by using a wider range of
> strike prices rather than just at-the-money series.

CAUTION! This repository is very large 

The City of Chicago is releasing selected datasets from the [data portal](http://data.cityofchicago.org 'Chicago Data Portal') under the MIT License (see below). This repository contains:

1. Data in a GeoJSON format.
2. Examples of importing data into R, Python, and Ruby.
3. Instructions to transform data from the data portal to data in the repository.

Working with GeoJSON Data
=========================

The data was released as a [GeoJSON](http://www.geojson.org/geojson-spec.html) file. Below are some simple instructions which will show you how to load GeoJSON in R, Python, and Ruby.

R
---

Find an example script [here](/examples/Importing%20GeoJSON%20R%20Demo.R 'Importing GeoJSON data to R'). This example will import the data in R and create a couple of maps.

Instructions:

1. Set the working directory to the location of the downloaded repository.
    ```r
    setwd(""path\\to\\osd-building-footprints"")
    ```

2. Install the ""rgdal"" library to let R read and translate the data from GeoJSON to a Shapefile. We will use ""ggplot2"" library to transform the spatial data frame to a regular data frame--and to make a map.
    ```r    
    install.packages(c(""rgdal"",""ggplot2""))
    ```

3. Load the libraries:
    ```r    
    library(rgdal)
    library(ggplot2)
    ```

4. Import data to a spatial dataframe. City data is typically created using the transverse Mercator projection.
    ```r
    ogrInfo(""data\\Buildings.json"", layer=""OGRGeoJSON"")
    buildings.shapefile <- readOGR(dsn=""data\\Buildings.json"", layer=""OGRGeoJSON"", p4s=""+proj=tmerc +ellps=WGS84"")
    ```

5. Lets convert the spatial dataframe to a typical dataframe.
    ```r
    buildings.table <- fortify(buildings.shapefile)
    ```

6. Review the new dataframe.
    ```r
    head(buildings.table)
    ```

7. Plot the data.
    ```r
    ggplot(buildings.table, aes(x=long, y=lat, group=group)) + geom_polygon()
    ```

Here is the output you should expect from the plot() command:
![plot(buildings.shapefile)](/examples/R-plot-buildings.png)

Here is the output you should expect from the ggplot() command:
![ggplot(buildings.df, aes(x=long, y=lat, group=group))+geom_path()](/examples/R-ggplot-buildings.png)
    
Python
------

Find an example script [here](/examples/Importing%20GeoJSON%20Python%20Demo.py 'Importing GeoJSON data to Python Demo').

1. Load the necessary json and pprint libraries.
	```python
	import json
	```

2. Open GeoJSON data file.
	```python
	buildings_json = open('PATH/TO/osd-building-footprints/data/Buildings.json', 'r')
	```

3. Check first few lines of data (repeat this command several times)
    ```python
    buildings.readline()
    ```

4. Load GeoJSON file.
	```python
	buildings = json.load(buildings_json)
	```

5. Close the open GeoJSON file.
	```python
	json.close(buildings_json)
	```

Ruby
----

An example ruby script is provided to show loading GeoJSON and running spatial analysis using the RGeo suite. A simple Gemfile is provided to make getting the dependencies and using them easy.

        $ cd PATH/TO/osd-building-footprints/examples/ruby
        $ bundle
        $ ruby example.rb

This example script filters the `Buildings.json` to street segments within a 500ft buffer of 50 W Washington.

Differences between data portal and this repository
===================================================

Though the data in this repository is also available on Chicago's data portal, the data in this repository is different in several ways. First, the data within this repository is released under the MIT License. Second, this data has been edited to remove internal codes which do not provide useful information. Third, after changes were made to the dataset, the original shapefile was converted to GeoJSON using [GDAL's](http://www.gdal.org/, 'Geospatial Data Abstraction Library') [ogr2ogr](http://www.gdal.org/ogr2ogr.html)

The translation from portal to repository involves several steps. First, the original DBF file is transformed using OpenRefine to elminate unhelpful columns and clean data. The ""Transformatons"" folder contains the corresponding JSON, which contains the detailed list of changes made to the original table.

The resulting shapefile is then translated to GeoJSON using the ogr2ogr from the GDAL application. The transformation is completed in the command prompt:

ogr2ogr -f ""GeoJSON"" Buildings_ogr.json /path/to/portal/data/Buildings.shp

Unfortunately, ogr2ogr outputs in machine, but not human-readable files. At this time, we have not translated this to a more human readable form due to the large file size.

The folder ""Transformations"" contains the necessary code to transform data on the portal to the release in this repository.

We are also inviting you to create [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/tategallery/collection/issues) if you notice any bugs or have any ideas for improving the data. Thanks for your help!

## Repository Contents

We offer two data formats:

1. A richer dataset is provided in the JSON format, which is organised by the directory structure of the Git repository. JSON supports more hierarchical or nested information such as subjects.

2. We also provide CSVs of flattened data, which is less comprehensive but perhaps easier to grok. The CSVs provide a good introduction to overall contents of the Tate metadata and create opportunities for artistic pivot tables.

### JSON

#### Artists

Each artist has his or her own JSON file. They are found in the `artists` folder, then filed away by first letter of the artist’s surname.

#### Artworks

Artworks are found in the `artworks` folder. They are filed away by _accession number_. This is the unique identifier given to artworks when they come into the Tate collection. In many cases, the format has significance. For example, the `ar` accession number prefix indicates that the artwork is part of ARTIST ROOMS collection. The `n` prefix indicates works that once were part of the [National Gallery](http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/) collection.

### CSV

There is one CSV file for artists (`artist_data.csv`) and one (very large) for artworks (`artwork_data.csv`), which we may one day break up into more manageable chunks. The CSV headings should be helpful. Let us know if not. Entrepreneurial hackers could use the CSVs as an index to the JSON collections if they wanted richer data. **NB CSV files are encoded as UTF-8 text, on which older versions of Excel may choke. We have inserted a UTF-8 BOM to help Excel detect the encoding, which may or may not be a terrible mistake.**

300k patient records generated to be nationally representative using NAMCS

This repo contains 300k patients generated using the patient-data-generator, which is powered off the 2012 NAMCS survey.  Results are sampled and slightly randomized from the NAMCS survey, and reformatted to be in a format more consistent with EHR data.

This repo also contains a sql script to compile the data into a single sqlite database.  To run, just execute the bash script:

    bash build-sqlite.sh

Or run build-sqlite.sql within sqlite.

This data, while intended to be nationally representative and clinically accurate, is not guaranteed to be such.  So, it's better for learning or testing methods on than for doing current public health or clinical research.

Emulationstation gamelists and images for recalbox.

This repository regroups gamelists and images for emulationstation systems in recalbox.

Rom names are based on ""NO-INTRO"" sets, that are very clean sets for many systems.

From the website of no-intro : 
>What ""No-Intro"" does is fill some .dat files, to be used with ROM-Managers, with information about the known ROMS released. Often there are more versions of the same ROM dump, but most of them are garbage, some examples may include: bad dumps, hacks, fakes, overdumps, underdumps, and so on. ""No-Intro"" lists only the best available ROM; it must be a full dump with no faults and no changes to the file, basically just the ROMS that are the closest as possible to the original licensed cartridges. 

See http://www.no-intro.org/ for more informations on their game database.


**If you want to contribute, here is the procedure :**
- Only use No-Intro data files.
- First, use the special scrapper at https://github.com/digitalLumberjack/scraper, it bases the scrape on games checksums, so you'll have no errors in scraped games.
- Then use babou's https://github.com/bbouko/Recalbox-scraper to scrape remaining games basing search on file names.
- If you add custom image, the maximum width should be 375px and the maximum height should be 350px.
- Create a pull request with the modified gamelists and images.

Spring Boot makes it easy to create Spring-powered, production-grade applications and
services with absolute minimum fuss. It takes an opinionated view of the Spring platform
so that new and existing users can quickly get to the bits they need.

You can use Spring Boot to create stand-alone Java applications that can be started using
`java -jar` or more traditional WAR deployments. We also provide a command line tool
that runs spring scripts.

Our primary goals are:

* Provide a radically faster and widely accessible getting started experience for all
Spring development
* Be opinionated out of the box, but get out of the way quickly as requirements start to
diverge from the defaults
* Provide a range of non-functional features that are common to large classes of projects
(e.g. embedded servers, security, metrics, health checks, externalized configuration)
* Absolutely no code generation and no requirement for XML configuration



== Installation and Getting Started
The {docs}/htmlsingle/[reference documentation] includes detailed
{docs}/htmlsingle/#getting-started-installing-spring-boot[installation instructions]
as well as a comprehensive {docs}/htmlsingle/#getting-started-first-application[``getting
started``] guide. Documentation is published in {docs}/htmlsingle/[HTML],
{docs}/pdf/spring-boot-reference.pdf[PDF] and {docs}/epub/spring-boot-reference.epub[EPUB]
formats.

Here is a quick teaser of a complete Spring Boot application in Java:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
	import org.springframework.boot.*;
	import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.*;
	import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;

	@RestController
	@SpringBootApplication
	public class Example {

		@RequestMapping(""/"")
		String home() {
			return ""Hello World!"";
		}

		public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
			SpringApplication.run(Example.class, args);
		}

	}
----



== Getting help
Having trouble with Spring Boot? We'd like to help!

* Check the {docs}/htmlsingle/[reference documentation], especially the
  {docs}/htmlsingle/#howto[How-to's] -- they provide solutions to the most common
  questions.
* Learn the Spring basics -- Spring Boot builds on many other Spring projects, check
  the http://spring.io[spring.io] web-site for a wealth of reference documentation. If
  you are just starting out with Spring, try one of the http://spring.io/guides[guides].
* Ask a question - we monitor http://stackoverflow.com[stackoverflow.com] for questions
  tagged with http://stackoverflow.com/tags/spring-boot[`spring-boot`].
* Report bugs with Spring Boot at https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues[github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues].



== Reporting Issues
Spring Boot uses GitHub's integrated issue tracking system to record bugs and feature
requests. If you want to raise an issue, please follow the recommendations below:

* Before you log a bug, please https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/search?type=Issues[search the issue tracker]
  to see if someone has already reported the problem.
* If the issue doesn't already exist, https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/new[create a new issue].
* Please provide as much information as possible with the issue report, we like to know
  the version of Spring Boot that you are using, as well as your Operating System and
  JVM version.
* If you need to paste code, or include a stack trace use Markdown +++```+++ escapes
  before and after your text.
* If possible try to create a test-case or project that replicates the issue. You can
  submit sample projects as pull-requests against the
  https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot-issues[spring-boot-issues] GitHub
  project. Use the issue number for the name of your project.



== Building from Source
You don't need to build from source to use Spring Boot (binaries in
http://repo.spring.io[repo.spring.io]), but if you want to try out the latest and
greatest, Spring Boot can be easily built with the
https://github.com/takari/maven-wrapper[maven wrapper]. You also need JDK 1.8 (although
Boot applications can run on Java 1.6).

[indent=0]
----
	$ ./mvnw clean install
----

If you want to build with the regular `mvn` command, you will need
http://maven.apache.org/run-maven/index.html[Maven v3.2.1 or above].

NOTE: You may need to increase the amount of memory available to Maven by setting
a `MAVEN_OPTS` environment variable with the value `-Xmx512m`. Remember
to set the corresponding property in your IDE as well if you are building and running
tests there (e.g. in Eclipse go to `Preferences->Java->Installed JREs` and edit the
JRE definition so that all processes are launched with those arguments). This property
is automatically set if you use the maven wrapper.

_Also see link:CONTRIBUTING.adoc[CONTRIBUTING.adoc] if you wish to submit pull requests,
and in particular please fill out the
https://support.springsource.com/spring_committer_signup[Contributor's Agreement]
before your first change, however trivial. (Or if you filed such an agreement already for
another project just mention that in your pull request.)_

=== Building reference documentation

The reference documentation requires the documentation of the Maven plugin to be
available so you need to build that first since it's not generated by default.

[indent=0]
----
	$ ./mvnw clean install -pl spring-boot-tools/spring-boot-maven-plugin -Pdefault,full
----

The documentation also includes auto-generated information about the starters. To
allow this information to be collected, the starter projects must be built first:

[indent=0]
----
	$ ./mvnw clean install -f spring-boot-starters
----

Once this is done, you can build the reference documentation with the command below:

[indent=0]
----
	$ ./mvnw clean prepare-package -pl spring-boot-docs -Pdefault,full
----

TIP: The generated documentation is available from `spring-boot-docs/target/contents/reference`


== Modules
There are a number of modules in Spring Boot, here is a quick overview:



=== spring-boot
The main library providing features that support the other parts of Spring Boot,
these include:

* The `SpringApplication` class, providing static convenience methods that make it easy
to write a stand-alone Spring Application. Its sole job is to create and refresh an
appropriate Spring `ApplicationContext`
* Embedded web applications with a choice of container (Tomcat or Jetty for now)
* First class externalized configuration support
* Convenience `ApplicationContext` initializers, including support for sensible logging
defaults



=== spring-boot-autoconfigure
Spring Boot can configure large parts of common applications based on the content
of their classpath. A single `@EnableAutoConfiguration` annotation triggers
auto-configuration of the Spring context.

Auto-configuration attempts to deduce which beans a user might need. For example, If
`HSQLDB` is on the classpath, and the user has not configured any database connections,
then they probably want an in-memory database to be defined. Auto-configuration will
always back away as the user starts to define their own beans.



=== spring-boot-starters
Starters are a set of convenient dependency descriptors that you can include in
your application. You get a one-stop-shop for all the Spring and related technology
that you need without having to hunt through sample code and copy paste loads of
dependency descriptors. For example, if you want to get started using Spring and JPA for
database access just include the `spring-boot-starter-data-jpa` dependency in your
project, and you are good to go.



=== spring-boot-cli
The Spring command line application compiles and runs Groovy source, making it super
easy to write the absolute minimum of code to get an application running. Spring CLI
can also watch files, automatically recompiling and restarting when they change.



=== spring-boot-actuator
Spring Boot Actuator provides additional auto-configuration to decorate your application
with features that make it instantly deployable and supportable in production.  For
instance if you are writing a JSON web service then it will provide a server, security,
logging, externalized configuration, management endpoints, an audit abstraction, and
more. If you want to switch off the built in features, or extend or replace them, it
makes that really easy as well.



=== spring-boot-loader
Spring Boot Loader provides the secret sauce that allows you to build a single jar file
that can be launched using `java -jar`. Generally you will not need to use
`spring-boot-loader` directly, but instead work with the
link:spring-boot-tools/spring-boot-gradle-plugin[Gradle] or
link:spring-boot-tools/spring-boot-maven-plugin[Maven] plugin.



== Samples
Groovy samples for use with the command line application are available in
link:spring-boot-cli/samples[spring-boot-cli/samples]. To run the CLI samples type
`spring run <sample>.groovy` from samples directory.

Java samples are available in link:spring-boot-samples[spring-boot-samples] and should
be built with maven and run by invoking `java -jar target/<sample>.jar`.



== Guides
The http://spring.io/[spring.io] site contains several guides that show how to use Spring
Boot step-by-step:

* http://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot/[Building an Application with Spring Boot] is a
  very basic guide that shows you how to create a simple application, run it and add some
  management services.
* http://spring.io/guides/gs/actuator-service/[Building a RESTful Web Service with Spring
  Boot Actuator] is a guide to creating a REST web service and also shows how the server
  can be configured.
* http://spring.io/guides/gs/convert-jar-to-war/[Converting a Spring Boot JAR Application
  to a WAR] shows you how to run applications in a web server as a WAR file.

## Getting started. ##

NodeGit will work on most systems out-of-the-box without any native
dependencies.

``` bash
npm install nodegit
```

If you receive errors about libstdc++, which are commonly experienced when
building on Travis-CI, you can fix this by upgrading to the latest
libstdc++-4.9.

In Ubuntu:

``` sh
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libstdc++-4.9-dev
```

In Travis:

``` yaml
addons:
  apt:
    sources:
      - ubuntu-toolchain-r-test
    packages:
      - libstdc++-4.9-dev
```

In CircleCI:

``` yaml
  dependencies:
    pre:
      - sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test
      - sudo apt-get update
      - sudo apt-get install -y libstdc++-4.9-dev
```

If you are still encountering problems while installing, you should try the
[Building from source](http://www.nodegit.org/guides/install/from-source/)
instructions.

## API examples. ##

### Cloning a repository and reading a file: ###

``` javascript
var Git = require(""nodegit"");

// Clone a given repository into the `./tmp` folder.
Git.Clone(""https://github.com/nodegit/nodegit"", ""./tmp"")
  // Look up this known commit.
  .then(function(repo) {
    // Use a known commit sha from this repository.
    return repo.getCommit(""59b20b8d5c6ff8d09518454d4dd8b7b30f095ab5"");
  })
  // Look up a specific file within that commit.
  .then(function(commit) {
    return commit.getEntry(""README.md"");
  })
  // Get the blob contents from the file.
  .then(function(entry) {
    // Patch the blob to contain a reference to the entry.
    return entry.getBlob().then(function(blob) {
      blob.entry = entry;
      return blob;
    });
  })
  // Display information about the blob.
  .then(function(blob) {
    // Show the path, sha, and filesize in bytes.
    console.log(blob.entry.path() + blob.entry.sha() + blob.rawsize() + ""b"");

    // Show a spacer.
    console.log(Array(72).join(""="") + ""\n\n"");

    // Show the entire file.
    console.log(String(blob));
  })
  .catch(function(err) { console.log(err); });

```

### Emulating git log: ###

``` javascript
var Git = require(""nodegit"");

// Open the repository directory.
Git.Repository.open(""tmp"")
  // Open the master branch.
  .then(function(repo) {
    return repo.getMasterCommit();
  })
  // Display information about commits on master.
  .then(function(firstCommitOnMaster) {
    // Create a new history event emitter.
    var history = firstCommitOnMaster.history();

    // Create a counter to only show up to 9 entries.
    var count = 0;

    // Listen for commit events from the history.
    history.on(""commit"", function(commit) {
      // Disregard commits past 9.
      if (++count >= 9) {
        return;
      }

      // Show the commit sha.
      console.log(""commit "" + commit.sha());

      // Store the author object.
      var author = commit.author();

      // Display author information.
      console.log(""Author:\t"" + author.name() + "" <"" + author.email() + "">"");

      // Show the commit date.
      console.log(""Date:\t"" + commit.date());

      // Give some space and show the message.
      console.log(""\n    "" + commit.message());
    });

    // Start emitting events.
    history.start();
  });
```

For more examples, check the `examples/` folder.

## Unit tests. ##

You will need to build locally before running the tests.  See above.

``` bash
npm test

The X-Plane Connect (XPC) Toolbox is an open source research tool used to
interact with the commercial flight simulator software X-Plane. XPC allows users
to control aircraft and receive state information from aircraft simulated in
X-Plane using functions written in C, C++, Java, MATLAB, or Python in real time over the
network. This research tool has been used to visualize flight paths, test control
algorithms, simulate an active airspace, or generate out-the-window visuals for
in-house flight simulation software. Possible applications include active control
of an XPlane simulation, flight visualization, recording states during a flight,
or interacting with a mission over UDP.

###Migrating to 1.0
For existing users, several important breaking changes have been made in version
1.0. For detailed information, see the 1.0 release changelog. For client-specific
guidlines on migrating to 1.0, refer to the follwing guides:

####[C](https://github.com/nasa/XPlaneConnect/wiki/Migrating-to-1.0-C)

####[MATLAB](https://github.com/nasa/XPlaneConnect/wiki/Migrating-to-1.0-MATLAB)

####[Java](https://github.com/nasa/XPlaneConnect/wiki/Migrating-to-1.0-Java)

###Architecture
XPC includes an X-Plane plugin (xpcPlugin) and clients written in several
languages that interact with the plugin.

####Quick Start
To get started using X-Plane Connect, do the following.

1. Purchase and install X-Plane 9 or 10.
2. Copy the X-Plane Plugin folder (xpcPlugin/XPlaneConnect) to the plugin
directory ([X-Plane Directory]/Resources/plugins/)
3. Write some code using one of the clients to manipulate X-Plane data.

Each client is located in a top-level directory of the repository named for the
client's language. The client directories generally include a 'src' folder
containing the client source code, and an 'Examples' folder containing sample
code demonstrating how to use the client.

####Additional Information
For detailed information about XPC and how to use the XPC clients, refer to the
[XPC Wiki](https://github.com/nasa/XPlaneConnect/wiki).

####Capabilities
The XPC Toolbox allows the user to manipulate the internal state of X-Plane by
reading and setting DataRefs, a complete list of which can be found on the
[X-Plane SDK wiki](http://www.xsquawkbox.net/xpsdk/docs/DataRefs.html).

In addition, several convenience functions are provided, which allow the user to
efficiently execute common commands. These functions include the ability to set
the position and control surfaces of both player and multiplayer aircraft. In
addition, the pause function allows users to easily pause and un-pause X-Plane's
physics simulation engine.

###Compatibility
XPC has been tested with the following software versions:
* Windows: Vista, 7, & 8
* Mac OSX: 10.8-10.11
* Linux: Tested on Red Hat Enterprise Linux Workstation release 6.6
* X-Plane: 9 & 10

###Contributing
All contributions are welcome! If you are having problems with the plugin, please
open an issue on GitHub or email [Chris Teubert](mailto:christopher.a.teubert@nasa.gov).
If you would like to contribute directly, please feel free to open a pull request
against the ""develop"" branch. Pull requests will be evaluated and integrated into
the next official release.

QNeuralNetwork (qnn) is a simple to use, customisable and efficient library for
neural network. QNeuralNetwork is written in C++/Qt.

QNeuralNetwork uses an easy internal model. A network is solely defined through
its type, its configuration and its gene. A gene contains a number of segments,
each segment is a list of numbers.

A network can be trained for a task using a genetic algorithm. The task is
contained in a simulation.

* LG Nexus 5 (""Hammerhead"")
* Fairphone 2
* Motorola Photon Q
* Jolla C / Intex Aqua Fish

Support can be added for any device with an LED that can be controlled using a simple switch file (e.g. file contents >0 for on, 0 for off) by mapping the hardware device name found in /etc/hw-release to the control file path using controlfile.conf.

Similarly, devices that have control files with variable brightness can set the max brightness in brightness.conf.

0. Introduction

Bakery is a framework to compute solutions for the shape packing problem
as described by Bennell and Oliveira (J. A. Bennell and J. F. Oliveira. 
A tutorial in irregular shape packing problems. The Journal of the 
Operational Research Society, 60:s93–s105, 2009).

Bakery was the winning entry of the InformatiCup 2016. For more 
information see: 
http://informaticup.gi.de/startseite/rueckblickearchiv/informaticup-2016.html

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Dependencies

To build and run Bakery Qt 5.4 or later is required. See 
https://www.qt.io/ for more information.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Building

The recommended way to build Bakery is to use QtCreator. Open
""bakery.pro"". If not already done configure the project by selecting
a kit and press the button ""Configure Project"". Use the ""Build All""
command to start the building process.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Graphical user interface

You can start the GUI from QtCreator by chosing run target ""gui"" (click
on the computer in the left panel) and executing the ""Run"" command.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Command-line interface

There is no convenient way to use the command-line interface from
QtCreator. To be able to start the binary from the command
line libbakery may need to to be added to the linker's library path
on Mac, Linux:

Mac:
    export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=""$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH:[path to libbakery]""
    
Linux:
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=""$LB_LIBRARY_PATH:[path to libbakery]""
    
On Windows Qt has to be in the PATH:
Windows:
    set PATH=%PATH%;C:\Qt\Qt5.5.1\5.5\mingw492_32\bin
    (if the installed version is 5.5.1 (MinGW32))
    
By default there is no time limit. To impose a time limit use the
-t/--time-limit parameter. A full list of available parameters may
be obtained by using the switch -h/--help.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. Source code documentation

The source code documentation can be build by using Doxygen
(doxygen.org). By default doxygen creates output as html, latex and 
Qt helpfile.

To generate the documentation switch the working directory to the bakery
directory and use the following command:
   doxygen

0. Introduction

The lack of certain types of geographic data prevents the development of 
location-aware technologies in a number of important domains. One such type of
“unmapped” geographic data is space usage rules (SURs), which are defined as
geographically-bound activity restrictions (e.g. “no dogs”, “no smoking”, “no 
fishing”, “no skateboarding”). We present a novel SUR mapping technique - SPtP
- that outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches by 30% for one of the 
most important components of the SUR mapping pipeline: associating a point 
observation of a SUR (e.g. a ’no smoking’ sign) with the corresponding polygon 
in which the SUR applies (e.g. the nearby park or the entire campus on which 
the sign is located). The accompanying  paper published at ACM CHI 2016 can be
found online at: http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2858036.2858053

Marcus Soll, Philipp Naumann, Johannes Schöning, Pavel Samsonov & Brent Hecht:
Helping Computers Understand Geographically-Bound Activity Restrictions.
CHI 2016: Proceedings of the International Conference on Human Factors in 
Computing Systems, 2016.

The data sets used for evaluation can be found at:
https://github.com/Top-Ranger/CHI2016-SUR-datasets

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Dependencies

SPtP requires Python 3. The following libraries need to be installed:
   pillow (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pillow/2.6.1)
   shapely (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Shapely/1.5.0)
On most systems these can be installed using pip, e.g.
   pip install pillow
   pip install shapely

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Batch processing

The batch processing script (run_batch.py) processes a text file containing
locations. A location has a name, GPS coordinates and any number of space
usage rules. The script is started by running run_batch.py, e.g.

   python3 run_batch.py

By default ""./input/surs.txt"" is the path to the locations file, ""./input/""
is the path to the folder containing images (and *.truth.kml files), results
files are stored in ""./output/"" and log files are stored in ""./log/"".

Please use the command line option ""--help"" to display detailed information on
available command line options, e.g.

   python3 run_batch.py --help

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Graphical user interface

The application features a web-based GUI which can be used with any modern web
browser. Running run_server.py will start the GUI server with default options,
e.g.:

   python3 run_server.py

By default the server is configured to listen on localhost:8080 using the
batch processing script's default paths for images, *.truth.kml and
results files.

More detailed information on available command line options may be displayed
by using the command line option ""--help"", e.g.

   python3 run_server.py --help

The server itself is a basic HTTP server. The web interface has three basic
functions:
1) Display a location previously processed by the batch processing script.
2) Manually enter a location to be processed. Uploading an image is optional
   and only possible if the browser supports the FileReader API.
3) Select layers (map tiles, buildings, polygons)

The information box in the upper right corner may be expanded by left-clicking
it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Unit tests

The application's unit tests may be performed by running run_test.py, e.g.

   python3 run_tests.py

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. Learning

The learning process allows the generation of factors which determine the 
weight of each weak classifier. A default factors file is included in this 
distribution (/data/factors.txt). The learning process uses input data at 
""./learning/db/"" for the learning process and input data at 
""./learning/test/"" for verification.

The learning process can be started by running run_learning.py, e.g.:

   python3 run_learning.py

The parameter of the learning process can be controlled through command line 
arguments. For more information run

   python3 run_learning.py --help

===================

The Qt Quick Controls 2 module delivers the next generation user interface
controls based on Qt Quick. In comparison to the desktop-oriented Qt Quick
Controls 1, Qt Quick Controls 2 are an order of magnitude simpler, lighter and
faster, and are primarily targeted towards embedded and mobile platforms.

Qt Quick Controls 2 are based on a flexible template system that enables rapid
development of entire custom styles and user experiences. Qt Quick Controls 2
comes with a selection of built-in styles:

- Default style - a simple and minimal all-round style that offers the maximum performance
- Material style - a style based on the Google Material Design Guidelines
- Universal style - a style based on the Microsoft Universal Design Guidelines

More information can be found in the following blog posts:

- http://blog.qt.io/blog/2015/03/31/qt-quick-controls-for-embedded/
- http://blog.qt.io/blog/2015/11/23/qt-quick-controls-re-engineered-status-update/

## Help

If you have problems or questions, don't hesitate to:

- ask on the Qt Interest mailing list http://lists.qt-project.org/mailman/listinfo/interest
- ask on the Qt Forum http://forum.qt.io/category/12/qt-quick
- report issues to the Qt Bug Tracker https://bugreports.qt.io (component: *Qt Quick: Controls 2*)

## Installation

The MINIMUM REQUIREMENT for building this project is to use the same branch
of Qt 5. The dependencies are *qtbase*, *qtxmlpatterns* and *qtdeclarative*.
Other optional dependencies include *qtgraphicaleffects* for the Material
style.

To install the controls into your Qt directory (```QTDIR/qml```):

    qmake
    make
    make install

If you are compiling against a system Qt on Linux, you might have to use
```sudo make install``` to install the project.

## Usage

Please refer to the ""Getting Started with Qt Quick Controls 2"" documentation.

## Overview


**mpv** is a media player based on MPlayer and mplayer2. It supports a wide
variety of video file formats, audio and video codecs, and subtitle types.

Releases can be found on the [release list][releases].

## System requirements

- A not too ancient Linux, or Windows Vista or later, or OSX 10.8 or later.
- A somewhat capable CPU. Hardware decoding might sometimes help if the CPU
  is too slow to decode video realtime, but must be explicitly enabled with
  the `--hwdec` option. On Windows, a CPU with SSE4 instruction set is required
  to get decent hardware decoding performance.
- A not too crappy GPU. mpv is not intended to be used with bad GPUs. There are
  many caveats with drivers or system compositors causing tearing, stutter,
  etc. On Windows, you might want to make sure the graphics drivers are
  current, especially OpenGL. In some cases, ancient fallback video output
  methods can help (such as `--vo=xv` on Linux), but this use is not
  recommended or supported.


## Downloads


For semi-official builds and third-party packages please see
[mpv.io](http://mpv.io/installation/).

## Changelog


There is no completely changelog, however changes to the player core interface
are listed in the [interface changelog][interface-changes].

Changes to the C API are documented in the [client API changelog][api-changes].

The [release list][releases] has a summary of most of the important changes
on every release.

Changes to the default key bindings are inidcated in
[restore-old-bindings.conf][restore-old-bindings].

## Compilation


Compiling with full features requires development files for several
external libraries. Below is a list of some important requirements.

The mpv build system uses *waf* but we don't store it in your source tree. The
script './bootstrap.py' will download the latest version of waf that was tested
with the build system.

For a list of the available build options use `./waf configure --help`. If
you think you have support for some feature installed but configure fails to
detect it, the file `build/config.log` may contain information about the
reasons for the failure.

NOTE: To avoid cluttering the output with unreadable spam, `--help` only shows
one of the two switches for each option. If the option is autodetected by
default, the `--disable-***` switch is printed; if the option is disabled by
default, the `--enable-***` switch is printed. Either way, you can use
`--enable-***` or `--disable-**` regardless of what is printed by `--help`.

To build the software you can use `./waf build`: the result of the compilation
will be located in `build/mpv`. You can use `./waf install` to install mpv
to the *prefix* after it is compiled.

Essential dependencies (incomplete list):

- gcc or clang
- X development headers (xlib, X extensions, libvdpau, libGL, libXv, ...)
- Audio output development headers (libasound/ALSA, pulseaudio)
- FFmpeg libraries (libavutil libavcodec libavformat libswscale libavfilter
  and either libswresample or libavresample)
  At least FFmpeg 3.2.2 or Libav 12 is required.
- zlib
- iconv (normally provided by the system libc)
- libass (OSD, OSC, text subtitles)
- Lua (optional, required for the OSC pseudo-GUI and youtube-dl integration)
- libjpeg (optional, used for screenshots only)
- uchardet (optional, for subtitle charset detection)
- vdpau and vaapi libraries for hardware decoding on Linux (optional)

Libass dependencies:

- gcc or clang, yasm on x86 and x86_64
- fribidi, freetype, fontconfig development headers (for libass)
- harfbuzz (optional, required for correct rendering of combining characters,
  particularly for correct rendering of non-English text on OSX, and
  Arabic/Indic scripts on any platform)

FFmpeg dependencies:

- gcc or clang, yasm on x86 and x86_64
- OpenSSL (has to be explicitly enabled when compiling ffmpeg)
- libx264/libmp3lame/libfdk-aac if you want to use encoding (has to be
  explicitly enabled when compiling ffmpeg)
- Libav also works, but some features will not work. (See section below.)

Most of the above libraries are available in suitable versions on normal
Linux distributions. However FFmpeg is an exception (distro versions may be
too old to work at all or work well). For that reason you may want to use
the separately available build wrapper ([mpv-build][mpv-build]) that first compiles FFmpeg
libraries and libass, and then compiles the player statically linked against
those.

If you want to build a Windows binary, you either have to use MSYS2 and MinGW,
or cross-compile from Linux with MinGW. See [Windows compilation][windows_compilation].


## FFmpeg vs. Libav


Generally, mpv should work with the latest release as well as the git version
of both FFmpeg and Libav. But FFmpeg is preferred, and some mpv features work
with FFmpeg only (subtitle formats in particular).


## Preferred FFmpeg version


Using the latest FFmpeg release (or FFmpeg git master) is strongly recommended.
Older versions are unsupported, even if the build system still happens to
accept them. The main reason mpv still builds with older FFmpeg versions is to
evade arguing with people (users, distros) who insist on using older FFmpeg
versions for no rational reason.

If you want to use a stable FFmpeg release, use the latest release, which has
most likely the best maintenance out of all stable releases. Older releases
are for distros, and at best receive basic changes like fixing critical security
issues or build fixes, and at worst are completely abandoned.

## FFmpeg ABI compatibility

mpv does not support linking against FFmpeg versions it was not built with, even
if the linked version is supposedly ABI-compatible with the version it was
compiled against. Expect malfunctions, crashes, and security issues if you
do it anyway.

The reason for not supporting this is because it creates far too much complexity
with little to no benefit, coupled with absurd and unusable FFmpeg API
artifacts.

Newer mpv versions will refuse to start if runtime and compile time FFmpeg
library versions mismatch.

## Release cycle

Every other month, an arbitrary git snapshot is made, and is assigned
a 0.X.0 version number. No further maintenance is done.

The goal of releases is to make Linux distributions happy. Linux distributions
are also expected to apply their own patches in case of bugs and security
issues.

Releases other than the latest release are unsupported and unmaintained.

See the [release policy document][release-policy] for more information.

## Bug reports


Please use the [issue tracker][issue-tracker] provided by GitHub to send us bug
reports or feature requests.

## Contributing


For small changes you can just send us pull requests through GitHub. For bigger
changes come and talk to us on IRC before you start working on them. It will
make code review easier for both parties later on.

## Relation to MPlayer and mplayer2


mpv is based on mplayer2, which in turn is based on the original MPlayer
(also called mplayer, mplayer-svn, mplayer1). Many changes have been made, a
large part of which is incompatible or completely changes how the player
behaves. Although there are still many similarities to its ancestors, mpv
should generally be treated as a completely different program.

mpv was forked because we wanted to modernize MPlayer. This includes
removing cruft (including features which stopped making sense 10 years ago),
and of course adding modern features. Such huge and intrusive changes made it
infeasible to work directly with MPlayer, which is mostly focused on
preservation, so a fork had to be made. (Actually, mpv is based on mplayer2,
which already started this process of removing cruft.)

In general, mpv should be considered a completely new program, rather than a
MPlayer drop-in replacement.

If you are wondering what's different from mplayer2 and MPlayer, an incomplete
and now unmaintained list of changes is located [here][mplayer-changes].

scikit-learn
============

scikit-learn is a Python module for machine learning built on top of
SciPy and distributed under the 3-Clause BSD license.

The project was started in 2007 by David Cournapeau as a Google Summer
of Code project, and since then many volunteers have contributed. See
the `AUTHORS.rst <AUTHORS.rst>`_ file for a complete list of contributors.

It is currently maintained by a team of volunteers.

Website: http://scikit-learn.org


Installation
------------

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

scikit-learn requires:

- Python (>= 2.7 or >= 3.3)
- NumPy (>= 1.6.1)
- SciPy (>= 0.9)

scikit-learn also uses CBLAS, the C interface to the Basic Linear Algebra
Subprograms library. scikit-learn comes with a reference implementation, but
the system CBLAS will be detected by the build system and used if present.
CBLAS exists in many implementations; see `Linear algebra libraries
<http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/computational_performance.html#linear-algebra-libraries>`_
for known issues.

User installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you already have a working installation of numpy and scipy,
the easiest way to install scikit-learn is using ``pip`` ::

    pip install -U scikit-learn

or ``conda``::

    conda install scikit-learn

The documentation includes more detailed `installation instructions <http://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html>`_.


Development
-----------

We welcome new contributors of all experience levels. The scikit-learn
community goals are to be helpful, welcoming, and effective. The
`Development Guide <http://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/index.html>`_
has detailed information about contributing code, documentation, tests, and
more. We've included some basic information in this README.

Setting up a development environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Quick tutorial on how to go about setting up your environment to
contribute to scikit-learn: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md

Testing
~~~~~~~

After installation, you can launch the test suite from outside the
source directory (you will need to have the ``nose`` package installed)::

    nosetests -v sklearn

Under Windows, it is recommended to use the following command (adjust the path
to the ``python.exe`` program) as using the ``nosetests.exe`` program can badly
interact with tests that use ``multiprocessing``::

    C:\Python34\python.exe -c ""import nose; nose.main()"" -v sklearn

See the web page http://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/advanced_installation.html#testing
for more information.

    Random number generation can be controlled during testing by setting
    the ``SKLEARN_SEED`` environment variable.

[![DOI:10.5282/ubm/data.61](https://img.shields.io/badge/DOI-10.5282%2Fubm%2Fdata.61-brightgreen.svg)](http://dx.doi.org/10.5282/ubm/data.61)

The goal of this project is to build a primitive but incredibly fast
reverse geocoding (coordinates to location lookup) system.

The basic principle is simple:
- extract polygons of each administrative region on OpenStreetMap (OSM)
- build a lookup map that can be stored reasonably
- to geocode coordinates, look them up in the map

The map will look roughly like this
(this is a visualization of the lookup map with 0.5 degree resolution
-- the finest has the 1000 fold resolution!):

![Visualization](data/osm-20151130-0.5-2.png)

However, things with OSM are not as easy as one may expect:

- OSM is a *lot* of data. It may use up all your memory easily.
  We are talking of 2.7 *billion* nodes for the planet file,
  and 270 million ways and 3.1 million relations.
  32 bits are not enough to store the IDs.
- The dump file is not well suited for random access. Instead, you
  need to process it in sequence. There are optimized data structures in
  the PBF file format that exploit delta compression; and strings are shared
  via a dictionary - and trust me, you don't want to process the XML dump
  using a DOM parser and XPath either...
- To reduce maintainance, OSM is heavily designed to share nodes and ways for
  multiple purposes. In particular for boundaries a single way can be used
  multiple times, such as denote the border of two countries, and participating
  in the polygons of countries, counties, cities at the border, ...
- Assembling polygons in OSM is quite tricky; and often polygons are incomplete
  (see also the documentation on [OSM multipolygons](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Relation:multipolygon))

My first prototypes in Python were running out of memory on the full data set;
reducing the data set via Osmosis did not work, as it led to missing ways. So I
needed to carefully build this in Java, to conserve memory. Osmosis reads and
writes data multiple times (to large temporary files) - I decided to design my
approach around reading the input data multiple times instead, even if this
means re-reading data unnecessarily, at the benefit of not having to write
large temporary files.

## Index Query

Quering the index is easy. It requires a single class,
[ReverseGeocoder](src/main/java/com/kno10/reversegeocode/query/ReverseGeocoder.java),
and a data file ([pregenerated data available under the ODbL license](data/))

**This class only depends on the JDK, on no other classes or packages.**

In particular, **you do not need a Mavenized package of this project**. For this reason,
I have also chosen a very permissive 2-clause BSD license for the lookup code.

    ReverseGeocoder rgc = new ReverseGeocoder(filename);
    // ...
    String[] metadata = rgc.lookup(longitude, latitude);

Pay attention to the order of longitude and latitude! The order of these two values
is inconsistent across different applications. This has been a mess historically,
and we are not going to fix this here. We chose longitude, latitude because it seems
more intuitive to us to use x, y as commonly seen on a map. This is also the
order used by [GeoJSON](http://geojson.org/). (Plus, the run length
encoding supposedly works better this direction.)

Each metadata entry is a tab separated array, as generated by the parser from the OSM file.
The exact columns are easy to vary. For the provided data files, there is
[documentation in the data folder](data/).

## Performance

So how ""incredibly fast"" is it?

I've added JMH unit tests to benchmark the throughput on a i7-3770 CPU with 3.4 GHz.
Values are given in microseconds (1us = 1e-6 s) per operation, and operations per microsecond.

| Method                             | Resolution | Runtime      | Throughput    |
|:-----------------------------------|-----------:|-------------:|--------------:|
| Lookup with caching of entities    |      0.5-2 |  0.231 us/op |  4.316 ops/us |
| Lookup with caching of entities    |     0.05-2 |  0.575 us/op |  1.706 ops/us |
| Lookup with caching of entities    |    0.005-2 |  0.971 us/op |  1.052 ops/us |
| Lookup with caching of entities    |   0.0005-2 |  1.562 us/op |  0.639 ops/us |
| Lookup without caching of entities |      0.5-2 |  0.683 us/op |  1.439 ops/us |
| Lookup without caching of entities |     0.05-2 |  1.114 us/op |  0.928 ops/us |
| Lookup without caching of entities |    0.005-2 |  1.423 us/op |  0.668 ops/us |
| Lookup without caching of entities |   0.0005-2 |  2.057 us/op |  0.473 ops/us |
| Open, query, close cycles          |      0.5-2 | 13.542 us/op |  0.078 ops/us |
| Open, query, close cycles          |     0.05-2 | 21.221 us/op |  0.048 ops/us |
| Open, query, close cycles          |    0.005-2 | 36.250 us/op |  0.027 ops/us |
| Open, query, close cycles          |   0.0005-2 | 84.306 us/op |  0.013 ops/us |
| Random lon+lat pair generation     |        n/a |  0.047 us/op | 21.297 ops/us |

As you can see, there is a benefit from using the caching included, and the setup cost of
the memory map is not negligible - it takes 50 times as long to open the file than to query.

The benchmark queries *random* coordinates. Some of these will be at the poles and in oceans.
The index is designed to have very stable lookup times, but lookups in asia tend to be slightly
slower than lookups in America due to the run-length encoding. For most applications, the
differences should remain neglible. In particular, the runtime is expected to increase
sublinear with the data resolution, not quadratic as with a naive map.

The last line in above table benchmarks the random number generation. This runtime can
therefore be subtracted from the other values.
On the 0.005-2 resolution data set, a cached lookup therefore is about 924 ns.
In one second, we can perform over 1 million lookups. (1 ops/us = 1 million ops/s)

Caching is not applied to coordinates, but to the decoding of UTF-8,
`'\0'`-delimited data into
an array of Java strings. As you can see, the string operations take about 400-500 us/op.
If your code is natively operating on UTF-8 encoded,
0-terminated strings (e.g. C code) then this is not needed.

Lookup times increase sub-linear with the data set size:

|Method                           | Resolution | Table size | Runtime     |
|:--------------------------------|-----------:|-----------:|------------:|
| Random lon+lat pair generation  |            |            | 0.047 us/op |

## OSM Data Extraction

We do a multi-pass process to build the index. **Unless you want to rebuild the index,
you can stop here. Everything you need to query is documented above.**

1. In the first pass, we ignore all nodes (the majority of the data).
We remember all ways and all relations we are interested in,
but no additional metadata to conserve memory.
2. We then build an index of the nodes we will need, and forget ways that we did not use.
3. In the second pass, we look at the nodes, but only keep those that we are
interested in. Since we only need a subset, this should fit into memory now
(at least if you have a machine with a lot of memory, like I do.)
4. In the third pass (since ways or nodes might be out of sequence), we
then can output the polygons for each relation, along with some metadata.

On my system, the each pass takes about 2 minutes (reading from a network share;
likely a lot faster if I had stored the source file on my SSD).

### Data Structures

We use Fastutil collections to conserve memory. These classes are excellent
hashmaps for *primitive* data types. For nodes, we also use a two level hashmap
with prefix compression, since node ids were given in sequence not randomly (and thus
have a lot of common prefixes - in particular, the first 20+ bits of each id are usually 0).

Since our desired output resolution is much less than 0.01 degree, we also encode
each coordinate approximately using a single integer.

### Implementation Notes

While `osmosis --used-way --used-node` did not work for me with tag filters, it
apparently worked just fine without. Using these filters can reduce the
planet file substantially, from 30 GB to 5.1 GB. This is worth
doing as a preprocessing step.

As of now, you *will* need to use a Debian Linux system.
Some of the libraries are not available on Maven central, so I had to put
system paths (have a look at the pom.xml, for what you need).

## Index construction

The index essentially is a large pixmap referencing metadata from OSM, accompanied
with a table containing the metadata from the index.

### Rendering

Rendering is currently done via JavaFX, so you will also need to have a UI for
building an index. Unfortunately, this is also rather slow (10-30 minutes,
depending on the desired resolution and number of polygons to render). However,
we needed an API that can render polygons with the even-odd rule and antialiasing,
and the java-gnome Cairo API wouldn't allow us access the resulting bitmaps without
writing them to disk as PNG.

Since the JavaFX renderer has a texture limit of 8192x8192, we need to render smaller patches
and combine them to get a high-resolution map.

### File Format

The file format is designed to be low-level, compact and efficient. It is meant to
be used via read-only shared memory mapping, to make best use of operating
system caching capabilities. The compression is less than what you could obtain with
PNG encoding or GZIP, but it allows skipping over data without decoding it into
application memory.

1. 4 bytes: magic header that identifies the file format. Currently,
this is the code 0x6e06e001, and I will increment the last byte on format changes.
2. 4 bytes: width of the map in pixel
3. 4 bytes: height of the map in pixel
4. 4 bytes: width of the map in degree
5. 4 bytes: height of the map in degree
6. 4 bytes: longitude offset of the map in degree (usually +180°)
7. 4 bytes: latitude offset of the map in degree
8. 4 bytes: number of entities (max 0x8000)
9. height * 4 bytes: file offset of each row (monotone increasing)
10. nument * 4 bytes: file offset of metadata (monotone)
11. file size (= end of last entity)
12. x bytes for each row, as listed before (row encoding: see below)
13. x bytes for each metadata

Each map row is encoded using a run-length encoding consisting of two varints.
The first varint is the entity number, the second is the run length - 1.
The varint encoding uses a variable number of bytes, where the first bit is 1
except for the last byte.

To compute the length of the metadata, read two consecutive index offsets and
compute the difference. Entries are UTF-8 encoded, and are both separated and
terminated with `\0` to make it easy to use them across different programming
languages.  Metadata usually includes tab characters to separate columns. The
exact column layout is not specified in this file format, but there is
[documentation in the data folder](data/) for the example data files provided.

This format is designed to provide reasonable compression, while still allowing
fast random access without having to decompress the full data. The UTF-8
encoded entities will often require decoding, and thus the sample implementation
includes a cache for the decoded strings.

## Visualization

The index construction will also produce a .png visualizing the map, as shown above.

## Improving the Data

I am aware there are areas where the data is not yet very good. For example in Portugal,
there is little detailed information, same for Western Australia. You are welcome to
contribute data: just contribute administrative boundaries
to [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/)!
For example there is a project to
[add administrative boundaries for Portugal](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/WikiProject_Portugal/Divis%C3%B5es_Administrativas/Lista_de_Divis%C3%B5es_Administrativas),
that already improved the data quality of this index for Portugal substantially.
Isn't that great?

## TODO

1. Include ocean information
2. Fallback to other data for e.g. Western Australia?
3. Further reduce file size / coding (but not at the cost of speed)
4. Use a custom renderer (line-based with RLE to reduce memory?) instead of JavaFX

### All of Foursquare's open source code in a single repo.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/foursquare/fsqio.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/foursquare/fsqio)

All Foursquare code lives in a single repository, an architecture generally called a monorepo.
`Fsq.io` is a subset of that internal monorepo. `Fsq.io` holds many of Foursquare's
open source projects that had previously lived in their own separate Github repos. Foursquare contributes
to a build tool specifically designed to work with monorepos called [Pants](https://pantsbuild.github.io/).
The entire `Fsq.io` repo is is built and tested by Pants.

Deploying directly from our monorepo has some nice advantages, for consumers of our open source projects as
well as Foursquare itself. The entire repo is built daily by our CIs and internal contributions are open sourced
automatically without the overhead of publishing. This repo will always contain the latest code that we use
internally, all of the tools can be built just as we use them, directly from HEAD.

## Projects include:
* [Exceptionator](https://github.com/foursquare/fsqio/tree/master/src/jvm/io/fsq/exceptionator):
An exception aggregator using mongodb.
* [Fhttp](https://github.com/foursquare/fsqio/tree/master/src/jvm/io/fsq/fhttp):
A request building interface similar to scalaj-http for Finagle http clients.
* [Pants pom-resolve](https://github.com/foursquare/fsqio/tree/master/src/python/fsqio/pants/pom):
A drop-in Python replacement for the Pants ivy resolver.
* [Rogue](https://github.com/foursquare/fsqio/tree/master/src/jvm/io/fsq/rogue): A Scala DSL for MongoDB
* [Spindle](https://github.com/foursquare/fsqio/tree/master/src/jvm/io/fsq/spindle): A Scala code generator for Thrift
* [Twofishes](https://github.com/foursquare/fsqio/tree/master/src/jvm/io/fsq/twofishes):
A coarse, splitting geocoder and reverse geocoder in Scala
* and others.


## Requirements

* JDK 1.8 (1.8.0_40 preferred)
* python2.6+ (2.7 preferred)
* postgresql
* [monogdb server](https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/) (required to pass some tests)
* An increased number of file descriptors (we use 32768)

Internally we use OSX Yosemite or later. Other OS may work but are officially unsupported. (_Unofficially_, if
building on Linux you should install `python-dev`, `build-essential`, and `libpq-dev` in addition to the above).


## Pants build system
Pants is a build system that works particularly well for a source code workspace containing many
distinct but interdependent pieces.

Pants is similar to `make`, `maven`, `ant`, `gradle`, `sbt`, etc. but pants pursues different design goals.
Pants optimizes for:

* building multiple, dependent things from source
* building code in a variety of languages
* speed of build execution

Pants is a true community project, with major contributions from Twitter, Foursquare, Square, among other
companies and independent contributors. It has friendly documentation [here](https://pantsbuild.github.io),
in this README we will just touch on how to compile and test the code.


## Compiling and Testing
#### First Run
The first run will take a long time as
[pom-resolve](https://github.com/foursquare/fsqio/tree/master/src/python/fsqio/pants/pom)
(our custom resolver for 3rdparty dependencies) computes the project graph and downloads the dependencies.
Maybe as long as 15-20 mins! A good first run is to get this out of the way:

     ./pants pom-resolve

#### Targets and BUILD files
Targets are adressable project or dependency level modules that can be built by Pants. `BUILD` files are
configuration files that define targets that can be built by Pants. Each target has a name and can be built
by running a Pants task against the target's name and location.

For example, Fsq.io's JVM projects live under `src/jvm`
[here](https://github.com/foursquare/fsqio/tree/master/src/jvm/io/fsq). You can compile Rogue by running:

     ./pants compile src/jvm/io/fsq/rogue:rogue

#### Build and Test every project
Adding a `::` to a path will glob every target under that location. So to compile every target in Fsq.io:

     ./pants compile src::

Similarly, to run all the tests, (after starting the mongodb server):

    ./pants test test::

Projects aspirationally have READMEs at the project root.

A pair of files for producing a SQLite database for working with Leauge of Legends game data.

For all files, you need to enter your personal Riot API key in the myKey variable.

Run 'Table Create.py' first; it generates the raw database schema and populates (mostly) static data. The code as written comments out the generation functions, as there's also a function for refreshing tables that normally contain static data. Due to game patches, the static data may come out of date, but you can re-apply those tables without affecting any game data. 

'Games Data.py' is the function to produce a list of Master and Challenger players and return their match history, populating tables. Due to API limits, the program can take over 24 hours to run fully, but produces a very robust database.

## Development

Requires Node.js.

Run `npm install` to get started.

`npm start` runs **./bin/serve.sh**, which watches the main CoffeeScript and Stylus files and runs a little server out of **./public** on port 3735 (looks like EYES).

`npm run stage` runs **./bin/build.sh** which builds and optimizes the site, and then deploys it to <http://demo.zooniverse.org/panoptes-front-end>.

All the good stuff is in **./app**. Start at **./app/main.cjsx**

### Conventions

React requires each component in an array to have a sibling-unique `key`. When rendering arrays of things that do not have IDs (annotations, answers), provide a random `_key` property if it doesn't exist. Ensure underscore-prefixed properties aren't persisted. That's automatic with the `JSONAPIClient.Model` class.

```coffee
<ul>
  {for item in things
    item._key ?= Math.random()
    <li key={item._key}>{item.label}</li>}
</ul>
```

### Async helper components

There are some nice components to help with async values. They take a function as `@props.children`, which looks a little horsey but works rather nicely. Most promised values we're dealing with are cached, so these are usually pretty safe, but if you notice the same request being made several times these are a good place to look. Here's an example of re-rendering for `auth` changes, which is pretty common.

```coffee
<ChangeListener target={auth}>{=>
  <PromiseRenderer promise={auth.checkCurrent()}>{(user) =>
    if user?
      <p>User is {user.display_name}</p>
    else
      <p>Nobody's signed in.</p>
  }</PromiseRenderer>
}</ChangeListener>
```

### CSS conventions

Include any CSS required to makes things work inline in the component, otherwise keep it in a separate file, one per component. For a given component, pick a unique top-level class name for that component and nest child classes under it. Keep common base styles and variables in **common.styl**. Stylus formatting: Yes colons, no semicolons, no braces. `@extends` up top, then properties (alphabetically), then descendant selectors. Prefer use of `display: flex` and `flex-wrap: wrap` to explicit media queries wherever possible.

```styl
// <special-button.styl>
.special-button
  background: red
  color: white

// <special-container.styl>
.special-container
  margin: 1em 1vw

  .special-button
    border: 1px solid
```

## Use in custom projects

If you're writing a custom project against the Panoptes API, you can use this module to handle authentication and data access. Install it with `npm install panoptes`.

```coffee
panoptes = require 'panoptes'

panoptes.auth.register {login, password, email}
panoptes.auth.signOut()
panoptes.auth.signIn {login, password}

panoptes.api.type('projects').get(SOME_PROJECT_ID).then (project) ->
  project.update display_name: 'A great project'
  project.link('workflows').then (workflows) ->
    workflows[1].delete()
    project.save()
```

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/meltingice/CamanJS.png)](http://travis-ci.org/meltingice/CamanJS)

The main focus of CamanJS is manipulating images using the HTML5 canvas and Javascript. It's a combination of a simple-to-use interface with advanced and efficient image/canvas editing techniques. It is also completely library independent and can be safely used next to jQuery, YUI, Scriptaculous, MooTools, etc.

CamanJS is very easy to extend with new filters and plugins, and it comes with a wide array of image editing functionality, which is only growing as the community makes more plugins. All features that are not a part of the core CamanJS library are in a [separate plugins repository](https://github.com/meltingice/CamanJS-Plugins).

For more information, I highly recommend taking a look at the [official website](http://camanjs.com) where there is more comprehensive documentation and interactive demos. You can also [read the wiki](https://github.com/meltingice/CamanJS/wiki) for some basic information about the project and how to use it.

CamanJS is written in [Coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org) as of version 3.0. **It works both in-browser and in NodeJS.**

## Usage

Include one of the versions in the `dist/` folder, then you can run:

```js
Caman(""#image-id"", function () {
  this.brightness(10);
  this.contrast(20);
  this.render(function () {
    alert(""Done!"");
  });
});
```

Caman also supports modifying images via the `data-caman` HTML attribute. Simply separate each instruction with a space. Images with the `data-caman` attribute will automatically be modified at page load.

```html
<img data-caman=""saturation(-10) brightness(20) vignette('10%')"" src=""path/to/image.jpg"">
```

### HiDPI Support

Version 4 introduces better support for HiDPI (Retina) displays. It allows you to specify a higher resolution replacement using HTML data attributes. Keep in mind, however, that higher resolution images take longer to render.

**HTML data attributes**

* `data-caman-hidpi`: URL to the high resolution replacement image
* `data-caman-hidpi-disabled`: HiDPI support is enabled by default, so add this attribute if you wish to force disable it

## Upgrading to Version 4

There is only 1 breaking change that occured with the version 4 release. When you initialize CamanJS with a canvas and an image, the parameter order has changed. It is now:

``` javascript
Caman(""#canvas-id"", ""/path/to/image.png"", function() {});
```

This is in order to be more consistent with initialization, such that the ""initialization object"" is always the first parameter. Update your code accordingly.

## Development

If you are a developer who is contributing directly to the project, there are some tools to help you out.

### Building

To install all dependencies required for development, run `npm install -d`.

Because all plugins are in a separate repository, make sure you run:

```
git submodule init && git submodule update
```

To build, simply run `cake build`. The resulting files will be placed in the dist/ folder. Plugins will be automatically discovered and added to caman.full.js after the core library. You can also auto-compile when a file changes by using `cake watch`.

If you add any files to the core library, you will need to add them to the `coffeeFiles` array in the Cakefile. The point of this is so that order is preserved when generating the file JS file. Plugins do not need to be added to the Cakefile.

You will probably want to generate documentation if you make any changes. In addition to the normal requirements, you will also need the Python library Pygments.

To generate the documentation, run `cake docs`.

## CDN JS Hosting

CamanJS is hosted on CDN JS if you're looking for a CDN hosting solution. It is the full and minified version of the library, which means all plugins are included. Simply load CamanJS directly from [this URL](http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/camanjs/3.3.0/caman.full.min.js) for usage on your site.

## NodeJS Compatibility

CamanJS is fully compatible with NodeJS. The easiest way to install it is:

```
npm install caman
```

**Saving from NodeJS**

To save your modified image in NodeJS, simply call the save() function **after** rendering is finished by passing a callback function to `render()`. Trying to save before rendering is finished will cause issues.

``` javascript
Caman = require('caman').Caman;

Caman(""./path/to/file.jpg"", function () {
  this.brightness(40);
  this.render(function () {
    this.save(""./output.png"");
  });
});
```

## Testing

Tests for CamanJS run both in NodeJS and the browser.

### NodeJS

The NodeJS tests use mocha as the test runner. The simplest way to run the test suite is by running `npm test`.

### Browser

The browser tests are run by Karma. It will start up Chrome, Firefox, and Safari (if running OSX) in the background. You can minimize each of these browsers if desired. It will automatically run tests after CamanJS is recompiled by the Cakefile as well.

You can run Karma by running `karma start`, or you can do a single run with the NodeJS tests by running `npm test`.

Prepare build
-------------

Get and install an Erlang system (http://www.erlang.org).

**To compile Yaws, Erlang/OTP R14B02 or higher is required.**

**For SSL-enabled instances, Erlang/OTP R16B01 or higher is required in order to allow only specific protocol versions.**

If you've cloned the source from github and you want to build using autotools,
note there is no ./configure script in the source, so create one:

    $> autoreconf -fi

Install build dependencies. Required packages to compile Yaws are (based on
debian packages):

* build-essential
* autoconf/automake/libtool
* erlang - Required apps:
 * erlang-{kernel/stdlib/sasl/erts}
 * erlang-compiler
 * erlang-crypto
 * erlang-xmerl
* libpam0g-dev

To build the documentation (optional), you also need to install:

* texlive-latex-base
* texlive-latex-recommended
* texlive-fonts-recommended
* texlive-font-utils
* texlive-extra-utils
* ghostscript

On Ubuntu/debian this is pretty much equal to:

    $> apt-get build-dep yaws

Finally, to run the testsuites, yaws need to install:

* git
* wget
* curl
* erlang-eunit
* erlang-inets
* erlang-mnesia
* erlang-ssl
* cadaver


Build
-----

You can build using rebar:

    $> rebar get-deps compile

or via autotools:

    $> ./configure --prefix=/usr/local

If using rebar, you'll get a ""local installation"" with Yaws script in ./bin
and the Yaws configuration file in ./etc/yaws.

If using autotools, the build will be configured by default for installation
under /usr/local. For more information about installation directories and
other supported options, see the configure help. Useful options are:

    --with-defaultcharset=CHARSET specify default charset, i.e UTF-8
    --with-extrainclude=DIR       dir to include if e.g. pam is installed in some odd place
    --with-erlang=PREFIX          prefix where Erlang is installed (optional)

Note to packagers (rpm, deb ...) All install targets support the DESTDIR
variable. Thus, if we do

    $> ./configure --prefix=/usr; make

we can subsequently do:

    $> make install DESTDIR=/foo/bar

All Yaws files will be installed under DESTDIR, but all code will assume Yaws
should be installed under /usr.

Main make targets:

* all           : compile Yaws
* debug         : compile Yaws with debug flags
* clean         : remove files produced by all or debug target
* install       : do a proper install of Yaws
* doc or docs   : build the documentation
* check or test : launch tests
* cleantest     : remove files produced by check target
* dialyzer      : run dialyzer on Yaws
* mkinstaller   : build an installer for windows
* cleaninstaller: remove files produced by mkinstaller target
* apps          : compile Yaws applications (chat,mail,wiki,yapp)
* cleanapps     : remove files produced by apps target
* installapps   : install Yaws applications
* fullinstall   : install + installapps
* fullclean     : clean + cleantest + cleanapps + cleaninstaller


Test your build
---------------

With autotools, to test the build, you should install it somewhere:

    $> ./configure --prefix=$PWD/_inst && make install
    $> $PWD/_inst/bin/yaws -i

If you used rebar to compile Yaws, you can alternatively start Yaws with

    $> ./bin/yaws -i

Either approach will start a webserver at http://0.0.0.0:8000
Terminate through ^C, or ^G followed by q, or

    > init:stop()

NOTE: If you've used rebar to build the system, none of the following
directions apply. With rebar only ""local installations"" are supported.


Install and run
---------------

NOTE: following commands may require root privileges, depending of the
installation prefix.

Just run:

    $> make install

Then, to run Yaws, you should use its script:

    $> ${bindir}/yaws -i

This starts an interactive system.

With the default yaws.conf file, this will create a webserver at
http://${host} and one at https://${host}.

You can adapt Yaws configuration by editing '${sysconfig}/yaws/yaws.conf'.


Daemonize Yaws
--------------

Start it using '--daemon' and '--heart' options:

    $> ${bindir}/yaws --daemon --heart

This will start a daemon (--daemon) which will be autorestarted when/if it
crashes or hangs (--heart).
Also, for most unices, we create proper start scripts in ${sysconfdir}/init.d

Example: Here is how I compile/start the yaws system that runs at
http://yaws.hyber.org (Ubuntu server system)

    $> autoreconf -fi
    $> ./configure --sysconfdir=/etc
    $> make && make install
    $> /etc/init.d/yaws start

> Progressive and customizable autocomplete component

Browser support includes every sane browser and **IE7+**.

# Demo!

You can see a [live demo here][3].

[![screenshot.png][5]][3]

# Inspiration

I needed a fast, easy to use, and reliable autocomplete library. The ones I stumbled upon were too bloated, too opinionated, or provided an unfriendly human experience.

The goal is to produce a framework-agnostic autocomplete that is easily integrated into your favorite MVC framework, that doesn't translate into a significant addition to your codebase, and that's **enjoyable to work with**. Horsey shares the modular design philosophy of [Rome, the datetime picker][1]. Furthermore, it plays well with [Insignia, the tag editor][2] component, and pretty much any other well-delimited component out there.

# Features

- Small and focused
- Natural keyboard navigation
- Progressively enhanced
- Extensive browser support
- Fuzzy searching
- Supports `<input>` and `<textarea>` elements

# Install

You can get it on npm.

```shell
npm install horsey --save
```

Or bower, too.

```shell
bower install horsey --save
```

# Options

Entry point is `horsey(el, options)`. Configuration options are detailed below. This method [returns a small API](#api) into the `horsey` autocomplete list instance. You can also find existing horsey instances using `horsey.find`.

### `suggestions`

An array containing a list of suggestions to be presented to the user. Each suggestion can be either a string or an object. If an object is used, the `text` property will be used for displaying the suggestion and the `value` property will be used when a suggestion is selected.

Alternatively, the `suggestions` can be a function. In this case, the function will be called when the input is focused, and expected to return a list of suggestions through a callback.

###### Example

The example below would create an instance with a predefined set of suggestions.

```js
horsey(el, {
  suggestions: ['sports', 'drama', 'romantic comedy', 'science fiction', 'thriller']
});
```

###### Example

Here's how you would lazy load your suggestions, except, you know, using actual AJAX calls. Note that this method is called a single time.

```js
horsey(el, {
  suggestions: function (done) {
    setTimeout(function () {
      done(['sports', 'drama', 'romantic comedy', 'science fiction', 'thriller']);
    }, 2000);
  }
});
```

### `filter`

Allows you to hide suggestions based on user input. The default implementation uses the [fuzzysearch][4] module to discard suggestions that don't contain anything similar to the user input.

###### Default

```js
function defaultFilter (q, suggestion) {
  return fuzzysearch(q, getText(suggestion)) || fuzzysearch(q, getValue(suggestion));
}
```

###### Example

The example below would always display every suggestion, except when the user input looks like `'seahawks/managers'`, in which case it would only return suggestions matching the `'seahawks'` team.

```js
horsey(el, {
  filter: function (q, suggestion) {
    var parts = q.split('/');
    return parts.length === 1 ? true : suggestion.team === parts[0];
  }
});
```

### `limit`

Allows you to limit the amount of search results that are displayed by `horsey`. Defaults to `Infinity`.

### `getText`

A function that returns the textual representation to be displayed on the suggestion list. The result of `getText` is also used when filtering _under the default implementation_.

###### Default

```js
function defaultGetText (suggestion) {
  return typeof suggestion === 'string' ? suggestion : suggestion.text;
}
```

###### Example

The example below would return a model's `displayName` for convenience.

```js
horsey(el, {
  getText: function (suggestion) {
    return suggestion.displayName;
  }
});
```

### `getValue`

A function that returns the value to be given to the `el` when a suggestion is selected.

###### Default

```js
function defaultGetValue (suggestion) {
  return typeof suggestion === 'string' ? suggestion : suggestion.value;
}
```

###### Example

The example below would return a model's `username` for convenience.

```js
horsey(el, {
  getValue: function (suggestion) {
    return suggestion.username;
  }
});
```

### `set`

A function that gets called when an option has been selected on the autocomplete.

###### Default

```js
function defaultSetter (value) {
  el.value = value;
}
```

###### Example

The example below would append values instead of overwriting them.

```js
horsey(el, {
  set: function (value) {
    el.value += value + ', ';
  }
});
```

### `anchor`

A string that will be used as a regular expression to figure out _when_ the suggestions should be presented. If an `anchor` is set, the text will be appended instead of replaced, and **the `set` option will be ignored**.

### `autoHideOnClick`

Hides the autocomplete list whenever something other than the `el` or any child of the autocomplete's `<ul>` element is clicked. Defaults to `true`.

### `autoHideOnBlur`

Hides the autocomplete list whenever something other than the `el` or any child of the autocomplete's `<ul>` element is focused. Defaults to `true`.

### `autoShowOnUpDown`

Displays the autocomplete list whenever the up arrow key or the down arrow key are pressed. Defaults to `el.tagName === 'INPUT'`.

### `render`

A function that's used to decide what to display in each suggestion item. `render` will take the `<li>` element as the first argument, and the suggestion model as the second argument.

###### Default

```js
function defaultRenderer (li, suggestion) {
  li.innerText = li.textContent = getText(suggestion);
}
```

###### Example

The example below would assign arbitrary HTML found in the `suggestion` model to each list item. Note that rendering doesn't necessarily have to be synchronous.

```js
horsey(el, {
  render: function (li, suggestion) {
    li.innerHTML = suggestion.html;
  }
});
```

### `appendTo`

Where should the `<ul>` element containing the autocomplete options be placed? Generally an irrelevant option, but useful if you're dealing with a SPA, where you want to _keep the element inside your view instead of the body_, so that it gets cleaned up as the view goes away.

Defaults to `document.body`.

### `form`

The `form` your `el` belongs to. If provided, the autocomplete list will be hidden whenever the form is submitted.

# API

Once you've instantiated a `horsey`, you can do a few more things with it.

### `.add(suggestion)`

Just like when passing `suggestions` as an option, you can add individual suggestions by calling `.add(suggestion)`. Returns the `<li>` element for this suggestion in the autocomplete list. There isn't an API method to remove the suggestion afterwards, so you'll have to grab onto the `<li>` reference if you want to remove it later on.

### `.clear()`

You can however, remove every single suggestion from the autocomplete, wiping the slate clean. Contrary to `.destroy()`, `.clear()` won't leave the `horsey` instance useless, and calling `.add` will turn it back online in no time.

### `.list`

The autocomplete list DOM `<ul>` element.

### `.suggestions`

Exposes the suggestions that have been added so far to the autocomplete list. Includes suggestions that may not be shown due to filtering. This should be treated as a read-only list.

### `.show()`

Shows the autocomplete list.

### `.hide()`

Hides the autocomplete list.

### `.toggle()`

Shows or hides the autocomplete list.

### `.refreshPosition()`

Updates the position of the autocomplete list relative to the position of the `el`. Only necessary when the `el` is moved.

### `.destroy()`

Unbind horsey-related events from the `el`, remove the autocomplete list. It's like `horsey` was never here.

### `.retarget(target)`

Detaches this `horsey` instance from `el`, removing events and whatnot, and then attaches the instance to `target`. Note that `horsey.find` will still only work with `el`. This method is mostly for internal purposes, but it's also useful if you're developing a text editor with multiple modes (particularly if it switches between a `<textarea>` and a content-editable `<div>`).

### `.anchor`

The anchor value that was originally passed into `horse` as `options.anchor`.

### `.defaultRenderer`

The default `render` method

### `.defaultGetText`

The default `getText` method

### `.defaultGetValue`

The default `getValue` method

### `.defaultSetter`

The default `set` method

### `.defaultFilter`

The default `filter` method

### `.appendText`

Method called whenever we have an `anchor` and we need to append a suggestion to an input field. Defaults to `defaultAppendText`.

### `.appendHTML`

Method called whenever we have an `anchor` and we need to append a suggestion for a `contentEditable` element. **Unsupported by default**. Provided by [banksy][8].

### `.defaultAppendText`

Default `appendText` implementation

### `.filterAnchoredText`

Method called whenever we have an `anchor` and we need to filter a suggestion for an input field.

### `.filterAnchoredHTML`

Method called whenever we have an `anchor` and we need to filter a suggestion for a `contentEditable` element. **Unsupported by default**. Provided by [banksy][8].

# Events

Once you've instantiated a `horsey`, some propietary synthetic events will be emitted on the provided `el`.

Name              | Description
------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------
`horsey-selected` | Fired after a suggestion is selected from the autocomplete
`horsey-show`     | Fired whenever the autocomplete list is displayed
`horsey-hide`     | Fired whenever the autocomplete list is hidden
`horsey-filter`   | Fired whenever the autocomplete list is about to be filtered. Useful to prime the filter method

### Usage with [woofmark][7]

See [banksy][8] to integrate `horsey` into [woofmark][7].

============

Ninja Blocks driver for the Orvibo AllOne IR blaster. Control your TV, air conditioner, S10 sockets and other IR goodies from your Ninja Block!

Important Notice
================

If you wish to use the Orvibo code (minus the Ninja Blocks stuff), check out the offshoot of this repo, [node-orvibo](http://github.com/Grayda/node-orvibo). You can install it with `npm install --save node-orvibo`. It's mostly the same as this library, but with (untested) RF support. Go check it out!

Installation
============

 1. Set up your AllOne and any S10 sockets you have via the WiWo / SmartPoint apps (this driver assumes you're all set up and ready to go)
 2. SSH into your Ninja Block and head to your driver directory
 3. Run this command: `git clone http://github.com/Grayda/ninja-allone && cd ninja-allone && npm install && restartninja`
 4. Reload your dashboard and any AllOne devices detected will show up.
 5. Type `LEARN` (must be in uppercase) into the text box and press ""Set Text"". This will put the AllOne into learning mode (solid red light)
 6. Grab your remote of choice and press a button. Keep the press short if possible
 7. `LEARN` will disappear from the box and be replaced with a long string of hex. **This is your IR code**. Use it in your rules and such. Save it somewhere because otherwise you'll need to program it again!
 8. S10 sockets will appear as relay devices. Toggle the switch to turn them off and on, or use the rules page to control them via other means
 9. The button on top of the Orvibo AllOne will appear as a separate widget on the dashboard. Use the rules page to do stuff when the button is pressed!
 
Using with rules
================

If you wish to use run rules when you press the physical button on top of the AllOne, go to http://a.ninja.is/you and find the rule element called [your AllOne's name]button. It's that simple!

Please note that it's not possible to control your Ninja Block using an IR remote. It may come at a later time, but for now it's technically not possible.

To-Do
=====

* ~~Allow saving and replay of learned IR codes (in progress)~~ Not possible due to limitations in the 433mhz widget, but research still ongoing
* Test with more than one AllOne
* ~~Roll the ninja-orvibo code into this for maximum socketness and blastering!~~
* Write an emulator for this device (?)
* Rename this project / merge it in with the ninja-orvibo driver, as this driver is no longer just about the AllOne

Supporting development
======================

I was born and raised on the open source software movement. If you like what I do, consider donating code, hardware or a few bucks to cover costs / Redbull.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/KushalP/mailcheck-clj.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/KushalP/mailcheck-clj)

A Clojure translation of the
[Kicksend mailcheck](https://github.com/Kicksend/mailcheck) javascript
library which suggests a right domain when your users misspell it in
an email address.

When your user types in ""user@hotnail.com"", Mailcheck will suggest ""user@hotmail.com"".

## Usage

Add the following to your list of dependencies:

```clojure
[mailcheck ""0.1.1""]
```

Then you can use it in a REPL as follows:

```clojure
(use 'mailcheck.core)
(suggest ""user@hotnail.com"")
=> {:address ""user"", :domain ""hotmail.com"", :full ""user@hotmail.com""}
```

What is CodeIgniter
###################

CodeIgniter is an Application Development Framework - a toolkit - for people
who build web sites using PHP. Its goal is to enable you to develop projects
much faster than you could if you were writing code from scratch, by providing
a rich set of libraries for commonly needed tasks, as well as a simple
interface and logical structure to access these libraries. CodeIgniter lets
you creatively focus on your project by minimizing the amount of code needed
for a given task.

*******************

An optimized general purpose gradient boosting library. The library is parallelized, and also provides an optimized distributed version.

It implements machine learning algorithms under the [Gradient Boosting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_boosting) framework, including [Generalized Linear Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_linear_model) (GLM) and [Gradient Boosted Decision Trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_boosting#Gradient_tree_boosting) (GBDT). XGBoost can also be [distributed](#features) and scale to Terascale data

XGBoost is part of [Distributed Machine Learning Common](http://dmlc.github.io/) <img src=https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/11508361?v=3&s=20> projects

============================================================

**openage**: a volunteer project to create a free engine clone of *Age of Empires II*,
primarily aimed at POSIX platforms such as **GNU/Linux**,
comparable in its goals to projects like [OpenMW](https://openmw.org/), [OpenRA](http://openra.net/), [OpenTTD](http://openttd.org/) and [OpenRCT2](http://openrct.net/)

openage uses the original game assets (such as sounds and graphics), but (for obvious reasons) doesn't ship them.
To play, you require *an original AoE II : TC installation or [AoE II: HD](http://store.steampowered.com/app/221380/)*
([Wine](https://www.winehq.org/) is your friend; in the near future, setup discs will be supported).

[<img src=""https://www.redditstatic.com/about/assets/reddit-logo.png"" alt=""reddit"" height=""50""> /r/openage forum](https://www.reddit.com/r/openage/)


The foundation of **openage**:

Technology     | Component
---------------|----------
**C++14**      | Engine core
**Python3**    | Scripting, media conversion, in-game console, code generation
**Cython**     | Glue code
**CMake**      | Build system
**OpenGL2.1**  | Rendering, shaders
**SDL2**       | Cross-platform Audio/Input/Window handling
**Opus**       | Audio codec
**Humans**     | Mixing together all of the above

Our goals *include*:

* Fully authentic look and feel
  * This can only be approximated, since the behaviour of the original game is mostly undocumented,
    and guessing/experimenting can only get you this close
  * We will not implement useless artificial limitations (max 30 selectable units...)
* Multiplayer (obviously)
* Matchmaking and ranking with a [haskell masterserver](https://github.com/SFTtech/openage-masterserver)
* Optionally, [improvements](/doc/ideas/) over the original game
* AI scripting in Python, you can use [machine learning](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
* Re-creating [free game assets](https://github.com/SFTtech/openage-data)
* An easily-moddable content format: [**nyan** yet another notation](https://github.com/SFTtech/nyan)
* A powerful integrated Python console and interface, comparable to [blender](http://blender.org/)
* Awesome infrastructure such as our own [Kevin CI service](https://github.com/SFTtech/kevin)

But beware, for sanity reasons:

* No network compatibility with the original game.
  You really wanna have the same problems again?
* No binary compatibility with the original game.
  A one-way script to convert maps/savegames/missions to openage is planned though.


Current State of the Project
----------------------------

 - What features are currently implemented?
   - See [doc/status.md](/doc/status.md).

 - What can I do once I start the game?
   - See [docs/usage.md](/doc/usage.md).

 - What's the plan?
   - See [doc/milestones.md](/doc/milestones.md). We also have a [list of crazy xor good ideas](/doc/ideas).


Dependencies, Building and Running
----------------------------------

 - How do I get this to run on my box?
   - See [doc/building.md](/doc/building.md).

 - I compiled everything. Now how do I run it?
   - Execute `./run`, you will be prompted by [the convert script](/doc/media_convert.md) to convert the original game assets to the (a lot saner and more moddable) openage format. The game starts when this is done..

 - Waaaaaah! It
   - segfaults
   - prints error messages I don't want to read
   - ate my dog

All of those are features, not bugs.

To turn them off, use `./run --dont-segfault --no-errors --dont-eat-dog`.


If this still does not help, try the [contact section](#contact)
or the [bug tracker](https://github.com/SFTtech/openage/issues).

ATM, openage is mostly designed to be built and run inside the development folder via `make run`, `./run`, `./run.py` or `python3 -m openage` (those all are equivalent), but `make install` might actually work!

To run the globally installed version: `python3 -m openage`.


Development Process
-------------------

What does openage development look like in practice?
 - extensive [syncronization](#contact)!
 - [doc/development.md](/doc/development.md).

Can I help?
 - [doc/contributing.md](/doc/contributing.md).


All documentation is also in this repo:

- Code documentation is embedded in the sources for Doxygen (see [doc readme](/doc/README.md)).
- Have a look at the [doc directory](/doc/). This folder tends to outdate when code changes.


OS X Version
------------

Building openage on OS X worked in the past, and might or might not work right now.
Setting up continuous integration for this platform has some complications. Running a hackintosh VM seems to be not so legal, while buying dedicated hardware for it seems to be not so cheap. If you know of a legal and cost-free way of doing so or want to sponsor a semi-recent Mac Mini, please open a ticket in our issue tracker. Until then, PRs untested on OS X will make their way into the master branch und occasional breakage will occur.


Windows Version
---------------

None of us uses Windows, so a port has low priority.

However, we're using cross-platform libraries wherever possible,
so a port should be pretty easy to accomplish.
We'll eventually look into porting using `mingw64`/`msys2`.

If you want to beat us to it, go for it!

We'd prefer as few preprocessor switches as possible, keep those centralized.


Contributing
============

* Being typical computer science students, we hate people.
* Please don't contact us.
* Nobody likes Age of Empires anyway.
* None of you is interested in making openage more awesome anyway.
* We don't want a community.
* Don't even think about trying to help.

Guidelines:

* No **bugreports** or **feature requests**, the game is perfect as is.
* Don't try to **fix any bugs**, see above.
* Don't implement any features, your code is crap.
* Don't even think about sending a **pull request**.
* Please ignore the [easy tasks](https://github.com/SFTtech/openage/issues?q=is:issue+is:open+label:%22easy%22) that [could just be done](https://github.com/SFTtech/openage/issues?q=is:issue+is:open+label:%22just+do+it%22).
* Absolutely never ever participate in this [boring community](https://www.reddit.com/r/openage/).
* Don't note the irony, you idiot.

To prevent accidential violation of one of those guidelines, you should *never*

* [learn git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Basics)
* [fork the repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo)
* [learn python](http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/appetite.html)

```

## Authenticated Requests
For methods that require authentication, you'll need to setup a client with
your login and password.

```ruby
client = Octokit::Client.new(:login => ""me"", :password => ""sekret"")
client.follow!(""sferik"")
```

Alternately, you can authenticate with a GitHub OAuth2 token. Note: this is
**NOT** the GitHub API token on your [account page][account].

[account]: https://github.com/account
```ruby
client = Octokit::Client.new(:login => ""me"", :oauth_token => ""oauth2token"")
client.follow!(""sferik"")
```

## Submitting a Pull Request
1. [Fork the repository.][fork]
2. [Create a topic branch.][branch]

## Supported Ruby Versions
This library aims to support and is [tested against][travis] the following Ruby
implementations:

* Ruby 1.8.7
* Ruby 1.9.2
* Ruby 1.9.3
* [JRuby][]
* [Rubinius][]

[jruby]: http://www.jruby.org/
[rubinius]: http://rubini.us/

If something doesn't work on one of these interpreters, it should be considered
a bug.

This library may inadvertently work (or seem to work) on other Ruby
implementations, however support will only be provided for the versions listed
above.

If you would like this library to support another Ruby version, you may
volunteer to be a maintainer. Being a maintainer entails making sure all tests
run and pass on that implementation. When something breaks on your
implementation, you will be personally responsible for providing patches in a
timely fashion. If critical issues for a particular implementation exist at the
time of a major release, support for that Ruby version may be dropped.

## Inspiration
Octokit was inspired by [Octopi][] and aims to be a lightweight,
less-ActiveResourcey alternative.

![Packet Sender Banner](screenshots/packetsender_dot_com.png)

Packet Sender is an open source utility to allow sending and receiving TCP and UDP packets. The mainline branch officially supports Windows, Mac, and Ubuntu Desktop Linux. Other places may recompile and redistribute Packet Sender. Packet Sender is free and licensed GPL v2 or later. It can be used for both commercial and personal use.


## Download
Official releases of Packet Sender can be downloaded at  [PacketSender.com](http://packetsender.com/). Some places redistribute Packet Sender.

## Packet Sender Documentation

Some knowledge of a basic network protocols is a prerequisite to using Packet Sender. Beyond that, Packet Sender was designed to be very easy to use. Simply start using it.


### Support

* Stack Overflow: [stackoverflow.com/search?q=packet+sender](http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=packet+sender)
* Twitter: [@NagleCode](http://twitter.com/naglecode)
* You may also track this project on GitHub.
* Secure Anonymous Email: [DanNagle.com/contact](http://DanNagle.com/contact)

### Portable Mode

Packet Sender has a ""portable"" mode. At launch, it will look for `packets.ini` and `ps_settings.ini` in its run-time directory. Windows users, this directory is the same place as the .exe. For Mac users, this run-time directory is at ""PacketSender.app/Contents/MacOS"". If INI files are found, it will use them instead of %APPDATA%"" or ""Library/Application Support"".

### Documentation (GUI)

Packet Sender is identical for all the desktop versions. The only difference is its theme to match the operating system.

![Packet Sender screenshot](screenshots/packetsender_windows_screenshot.png)


* In the bottom right, there are UDP server and TCP server status and port. You can click to activate or deactivate these.
* During packet resending, there will be a button to cancel all resends.
* Please check your firewall. Windows aggressively blocks TCP-based servers. Packet Sender will still work if the firewall blocks it, but it can't receive unsolicited TCP-based packets.
* In the table, there is a list of saved packets. You can double-click to directly edit fields in this table.
* Select multiple packets to enable ""Multi-Send"". Selected packets are shown in a quick-send area above the traffic log.
* Fields can be rearranged by drag-and-drop in the settings menu.
* A resend value of ""0"" means it is a single-shot packet.
* A packet has a name, destination address (domains will trigger an IP lookup), port, and data associated with it.
* Click ""Send"" to immediately send. Click ""Save"" to send later.
* Packet Sender supports mixed ASCII and HEX notation:
  * \XX gets translated to XX in hex
  * \n and \r will get translated to 0A and 0D
  * HEX numbers are space delimited
  * Example ASCII: hello world\r
  * Example HEX: 68 65 6c 6c 6f 20 77 6f 72 6c 64 0d
  * You may save a packet directly from the traffic log. You will be prompted for a name, and the source address and port will be switched for your convenience.
* An optional response can be sent. The same response is used for TCP and UDP.

### Persistent TCP
Packet Sender supports persistent connections via a separate UI dialog. It is enabled by  checkbox on the main window.
* ![Packet Sender Direct TCP](screenshots/packetsender_direct_tcp.png)
* Any number of persistent connections can be created.
* Previously saved packets can be loaded in the drop-down.
* There is a ""raw"" view and ""ASCII"" view. The ASCII view is useful to troubleshoot data that is not printed by the raw view.
* Traffic is also saved in the main window traffic log.
* The timer in the bottom lefts starts as soon as a valid data packet is sent. It stops when the server closes the connection.
* You may optionally append a carriage return when you quick-send by hitting the return key. This is useful for command-prompt menus over TCP connections.

Persistent connections is not supported via the command line.

### Additional Configuration Options

* The traffic log and packet table is divided by a draggable splitter. This splitter can also be collapsed on either side.
* Copy to the clipboard the raw packet data (instead of a translation -- my personal preference)
* Traffic log can be set to roll at 100 entries.
* Import/Export of packets is available via menus.
* Attempt receive before send (some servers expect this behavior).
* 500 ms delay before sending data (some servers are slow).

## Documentation (Command Line)

The command line extension used in Windows installations is .com. Using .exe will launch the GUI. Leave off the extension and Windows will choose the correct program. The same executable controls the command line and GUI for Mac and Linux operating systems.

![Packet Sender CLI screenshot](screenshots/packetsender_command_line.png)

The command line system in Packet Sender follows the same pattern as other Linux utilities. It has a long name (such as --version) and a short name (such as -v). These options can be arranged in any order and Packet Sender will parse them correctly. The last 3 options are positional and must appear last. They are IP, port, and data. These last options are optional if using a stored packet.

A [maturity model](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/MaturityModel.html) is a tool to assess the effectiveness of behaviors, practices and processes in producing the desired outcomes. The model defines a set of structured levels that lead an organization down a path of more systematically organized and mature processes.

Embracing open source software is not a single act, but a series of steps, varying in complexity, that require unique knowledge and processes at each step. A maturity model for embracing open source software will guide an organization through the process of successfully adopting open source.

## Objectives

An organization applying the maturity model aims to:

- Produce higher quality products and services built on open source software components.
- Create value by using open source as a force multiplier, shifting limited resources from low-value work to high-value work, focusing on core competencies, and benefiting from the expertise of the community.
- Gain industry-wide recognition that serves as advertising, recruiting, or general leadership.

## Actors

There are several roles in an organization that face unique benefits and challenges with adopting open source.

- **Developers** interact directly with the code and witness the material benefits of open source. They experience the difference between writing custom code and finding high-quality reusable components on the internet.
- **Technical leadership** benefits from the increase in quality and efficiency of their teams, but has to be aware of the long-term consequences of the adopted technologies.
- **Security** benefits from software that is open for inspection and has been potentially reviewed and hardened by the community, but has to continuously monitor for un-vetted code as well as vulnerabilities and exposures.
- **Operations** benefit from reduced costs for software procurement and licensing.
- **Legal** benefits from standardized software licenses, but has to monitor for intellectual property concerns.
- **Business leadership** benefits from increased efficiency and quality, the reduction of unnecessary overhead, and the opportunity for alternate business models, but has to navigate the risk of disrupting core business value.

## Structure

This maturity model is inspired by the [Capability Maturity Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability_Maturity_Model). The model involves six components:

![](resources/structure.png)


- **Dimensions:** aspects that require maturity in different _Key Process Areas_.

- **Maturity Levels:** a continuum of five level levels that indicate the ability for processes to produce the desired results.

- **Key Process Areas:** a cluster of related activities that, when performed together, achieve a set of goals considered important.

- **Goals:** The goals signify the scope, boundaries, and intent of each key process area, and the extent to which the goals have been accomplished is an indicator of capability at that maturity level.

- **Common Features:** practices that implement and institutionalize a key process area. There are five types of common features: commitment to perform, ability to perform, activities performed, measurement and analysis, and verifying implementation.

- **Key Practices:** elements of infrastructure and practice that contribute most effectively to the implementation and institutionalization of the area.

## Dimensions

There are three dimensions to embracing open source:

1. Consuming open source software.
2. Contributing back to the open source projects you consume.
3. Producing your own open source software.

## Levels

1. **Ad-hoc** - a new or undocumented process is uncontrolled, reactive and unpredictable, typically driven by individuals without coordination or communication. Success depends on individual heroics.

2. **Managed** - a process is partially documented, possibly leading to consistent results. Success depends on discipline.

3. **Defined** - a process is documented, standardized, and integrated into other processes. Success depends on automation.

4. **Measured** - the process is quantitatively managed. Success depends on measuring metrics against business goals.

5. **Optimized** - the process is continually and reliably improving through both incremental and innovative changes. Success depends on reducing the risk of change.

## Potential applications of the Maturity Model

The maturity model is being developed with two primary goals in mind:

- Evaluating how GitHub products, programs, services, and resources are helping customers develop more mature practices around open source.

- Creating a comprehensive _starter kit_ that includes all the resources needed to use, contribute to, release, and manage open source projects on GitHub.

## Current Status

The maturity model is currently a very early concept and actively being developed.

* [Sticky Notes for brainstorming the activities involved in open source](https://stickies.io/boards/564eda3fefefba0b2fe8a072#1)
* Bookmarks, primary sources, and notes are being gathered in an [Evernote notebook](https://www.evernote.com/pub/bkeepers/maturitymodel)

========================================

Dieses Git Repository enthält alle Deutschen Bundesgesetze und -verordnungen
im [Markdown-Format](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). Als Quelle
dienen die XML-Versionen der Gesetze von
[www.gesetze-im-internet.de](http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/).


Warum Git?
----------

Jeder Bürger kann den aktuellen Stand von Gesetzen sehr einfach online finden.
Allerdings ist die Entstehung, die historische Entwicklung und die
Aktualisierung von Gesetzen nicht einfach und frei nachvollziehbar. Das liegt
daran, dass Gesetze nur in ihrer aktuellsten Version präsentiert werden und
Änderungen an diesen Gesetzen nicht maschinenlesbar vorliegen. Dies soll hier
geändert werden: die aktuellste Version eines Gesetzes wird hier mit Git
versioniert gespeichert. Das erlaubt es, die Mächtigkeit von Git auf Gesetze
und auf den Gesetzgebungsprozess anzuwenden. Das Einpflegen der kompletten
deutschen Gesetzesvergangenheit in Git ist das ferne Ziel.


Warum Markdown?
---------------

Gesetze sind Prosa, sie enthalten keine maschinenlesbare Semantik. Eine
Auszeichnungssprache wie XML verringert die Menschenlesbarkeit, erschwert die
maschinelle Erkennung von Unterschieden und beinhaltet viel überflüssige
Syntax.

Markdown ist eine intuitive Formatierung von Text, die ohne zusätzliche
Programme für Menschen les- und schreibbar ist. Das passt zu Gesetzestexten,
die nur minimale Formatierung benötigen. Weiterhin lässt sich Markdown in
andere Formate wie HTML konvertieren und ist damit maschinen-formatierbar.


Pull Requests
-------------

Pull Requests können gerne geöffnet werden. Natürlich werden nur solche
gemergt, die tatsächlich vom Bundestag verabschiedet wurden und Gesetz
geworden sind.

Dennoch sind Änderungsvorschläge an Gesetzen von Parteien oder aus der
Zivilgesellschaft als Pull Request nützlich. Die Änderungen lassen sich
einfacher im Kontext verstehen, können direkt am Gesetz diskutiert und
nachvollziehbar verändert werden.

Offizielle Gesetzesentwürfe, wenn öffentlich verfügbar, werden vom Fork der
[Bundesregierung](https://github.com/bundesregierung/) als Pull Request an
dieses Repository gestellt.


Fehler und Bitte um Mithilfe
----------------------------

Es wird kein Anspruch auf Korrektheit erhoben. Bitte verlassen Sie sich nur
auf offizielle Quellen.

Die XML-Quelle ist nicht fehlerfrei und die Konvertierung von XML nach
Markdown ist es auch nicht. Das liegt daran, dass die Gesetze im XML-Format
das Markup auch für stilistische Auszeichnungen statt nur für semantische
Auszeichnungen nutzen. Dies erschwert eine Konvertierung und führt zu
fehlerhaftem Markdown. Da fehlerhaftes Markdown immer noch gut lesbar ist,
führt dies erst bei einer Weiterverarbeitung zu Problemen.

Commits richten sich nach Möglichkeit nach den Veröffentlichungen im
Bundesgesetzblatt und im Amtlichen Teil des Bundesanzeigers. Das funktioniert
nicht immer problemlos und erfordert menschliche Unterstützung.
Werkzeuge, die die Aktualisierung vereinfachen finden sich im
[gesetze-tools repository](https://github.com/bundestag/gesetze-tools).
Mithilfe ist erwünscht.

Um die Fähigkeiten von Git optimal zu nutzen, wird es nötig sein Commits, die
Gesetzesänderungen einbringen, von Commits, die z.B. Korrekturen an der Syntax
vornehmen oder die README verändern zu unterscheiden. Hier wird um Mithilfe
bei der [Ausarbeitung eines Git-Workflows](https://github.com/bundestag/gesetze/wiki/Git-Workflow)
für dieses Repostiory gebeten.


Rechtliches

Gesetze sind amtliche Werke und unterliegen nicht dem Urheberrecht.

(english version)

German Federal Laws and Regulations
===================================

This Git repository contains all German federal laws and regulations in
[Markdown format](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). The source
is the XML version of the laws from
[www.gesetze-im-internet.de](http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/).


Why Git?
----------

All German citizens can easily find an up-to-date version of their laws online.
However, the legislation process, the historic evolution and the updates to laws
are not easily and freely trackable. The reason is that laws are only published
in their most recent version and changes to laws are not available in a
machine-readable format.
This should change: the current state of laws will be stored in this repository
under Git version control. This allows the power of Git to be applied to the
legislation process. Integrating the whole history of German law changes in Git
is the ambitious goal.


Why Markdown?
-------------

Laws are prose, they do not contain machine-readable semantics.
A complex markup language like XML reduces the human-readability,
makes detection of differences harder and contains lots of
unnecessary syntax.

Markdown is an intuitive formatting of text, that is readable and
writable by humans without the need of additional tools. That fits
the nature of laws that only need minimal formatting. Furthermore,
Markdown is machine-formattable and can be converted to other formats
like HTML.


Pull Requests
-------------

You are encouraged to open pull request. Of course only valid legislation
voted on by the Bundestag will be merged.

However, law change proposals as pull requests coming from parties or
NGOs can be useful to understand context, discuss changes directly where
they will happen and keep changes accountable.

Official change proposals from our government will be opened as pull
requests from the fork of the [Bundesregierung](https://github.com/bundesregierung/)
as they become publicy available.


Mistakes and call for help
--------------------------

There is no guarantee on correctness. Please only trust official sources.

The source XML is not without mistakes and neither is the conversion to
Markdown. That's because the source XML uses markup for style and not only
for semantics. This makes conversion harder and comes down to faulty
Markdown. However, faulty Markdown is still very readable and will only
cause problems when processed further.

Commits will be based on published changes (Bundesgesetzblatt and Bundesanzeiger).
That doesn't work without problems and requires human interaction.
Tools that make updates easier can be found in the
[gesetze-tools repository](https://github.com/bundestag/gesetze-tools).
Help needed.

In order to make the most out of Git we need to distinguish between law change
commits and commits that fix e.g. syntax mistakes.
Please help shape a [Git Workflow](https://github.com/bundestag/gesetze/wiki/Git-Workflow)
for this repository.


Legal Stuff
-----------

All laws are offical works and are not under copyright law.

# LaTeX-Quellen übersetzen

Es gibt ein `Rakefile`. Dieses kann auf 2 Weisen genutzt werden.

Übersetze alle .tex-Dateien im Ordner src/ in gleichnamige PDF-Dateien

    rake

Starte preview-Modus mit latexmk für eine bestimmte .tex-Datei

    rake dateinamemitpunktpdfstattpunkttex.pdf

Eine Übersicht über alle Tasks gibt es mit

    rake -T

Alle gebauten Dateien löschen geht mit

    rake clean

# conf.json

Diese Datei enthält Konfigurationen, die für einzelne Dokumente wichtig sind. Im nächsten
Abschnitt wird im Einzelnen darauf eingegangen.

# Dokumente

Hier eine Übersicht aller Dokumente:

## ausgaben.tex

Übersicht über alle Ausgaben

## fuehrungen.tex

Stationen der Campus-Führungen

### Konfiguration

In der `conf.json` kann man einmal die Anzahl der Gruppen und dann die Stationen konfigurieren.

```json
{
  ""fuehrungen"": {
    ""num"": 8,
    ""sections"": [
      {
        ""name"": ""Gebäude 25"",
        ""stations"": [
          { ""name"": ""FS-Info"", ""hinweise"": ""Startposition -- An Frau Rennwanz vorbeilaufen beim kommen oder gehen. Frau Rennwanz macht Regen und Feuer!"" }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Das Ausführen von `rake fuehrungen.pdf` erzeugt dann alle Führungen in `src/fuehrungen/`, was
nicht versioniert wird. __Zusätzlich__ muss in der Datei `src/fuehrungen.tex` darauf geachtet
werden, alle Führungen mit `\input` einzubinden.

## gruppenzettel_rallye.tex

## laufzettel_rallye.tex

## pruefungsordnung.tex

## schnitzeljagd.tex

## spielregeln.tex

## spielregeln_schnitzeljagd.tex

## stationen_rallye.tex

# Arbeit am Repository

Die PDF-Dateien im `build/`-Ordner sollten mit versioniert werden. Dabei sollte
darauf geachtet werden, dass die generierte PDF immer mit der TeX-Datei im
commit übereinstimmt. Die Verwendung von latexmk bzw. das Rakefile hilft dabei.

Sollten andere Tools als das Rakefile zum bauen benutzt werden, so ist darauf
zu achten, die PDFs nicht im Hauptverzeichnis zu versionieren, damit das
Repository einigermaßen sauber bleibt.

WebAssembly is currently being designed as an open standard by a [W3C Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/webassembly/) that includes representatives from all major browsers. *Expect the contents of this repository to be in flux: everything is still under discussion.*

- **WebAssembly is efficient and fast**: Wasm [bytecode](Semantics.md) is designed to be encoded in a size- and load-time-efficient [binary format](BinaryEncoding.md). WebAssembly aims to execute at native speed by taking advantage of [common hardware capabilities](Portability.md#assumptions-for-efficient-execution) available on a wide range of platforms.

- **WebAssembly is safe**: WebAssembly describes a [memory-safe](Security.md#memory-safety), sandboxed [execution environment](Semantics.md#linear-memory) that may even be implemented inside existing JavaScript virtual machines.  When [embedded in the web](Web.md), WebAssembly will enforce the same-origin and permissions security policies of the browser.

- **WebAssembly is open and debuggable**: WebAssembly is designed to be pretty-printed in a [textual format](TextFormat.md) for debugging, testing, experimenting, optimizing, learning, teaching, and writing programs by hand. The textual format will be used when [viewing the source](FAQ.md#will-webassembly-support-view-source-on-the-web) of wasm modules on the web.

- **WebAssembly is part of the open web platform**: WebAssembly is designed to maintain the versionless, feature-tested, and backwards-compatible [nature of the web](Web.md). WebAssembly modules will be able to call into and out of the JavaScript context and access browser functionality through the same Web APIs accessible from JavaScript. WebAssembly also supports [non-web](NonWeb.md) embeddings.

## Design Process & Contributing

The WebAssembly specification is being developed in the [spec repository](https://github.com/WebAssembly/spec/). For now, high-level design discussions should continue to be held in the design repository, via issues and pull requests, so that the specification work can remain focused.

We've mapped out features we expect to ship:

 1. An initial [Minimum Viable Product (MVP)](MVP.md) release;
 2. And soon after in [future versions](FutureFeatures.md).

=======================

This repository contains the Perl 6 design documents, also called ""Synopses"",
in Pod (5 and 6) format. A [regularly updated HTML
version](http://design.perl6.org/) is available.

Historically, these documents have determined the direction of Perl 6. As
implementations matured, this role shifted (and still shifts) towards
documenting the experience from the implementations.

Instead the [test suite](https://github.com/perl6/roast/) is becoming the
specification, and the ""specs"" in the repository name of the design documents
tends to mean ""speculations"" now.

## Constitution

### Generate as PDF

To compile the Constitution, you need to have installed a `xelatex` compiler, which comes with TeX Live and other package sets.

Then run: `xelatex constitution.tex` twice and open the resulting PDF file.

### Generate as HTML

Requires Python 3, with `lxml` and `roman` packages (see below).

Run: `python3 convert_tex_to_html.py > file.html` and open the resulting HTML file.

## convert_tex_to_html.py

Script options:

- `-F`, `--final` - removes draft markings.
- `-d yyyy-mm-dd`, `--date` - changes the default date (today) to whatever is specified.
- `-f document.tex`, `--file` - changes the default input TeX file (constitution.tex) to whatever is specified.
- `-T Title\ Goes\ Here`, `--title` - defines the title (if empty, prints blank).
- `-P`, `--parts` - used for documents with parts (numbered with Roman numerals).
- `-toc`, `--toc` - adds a table of contents using the highest heading level in the document.

Example: `python3 convert_tex_to_html.py > output.html -f input.tex -T Title -P`

This will make output.html from input.tex, the contents will be titled 'Title', and it will have part numbering.

The input TeX file can be very basic and does not need a preamble:

```
\part{Part i}

\section{Section 1}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Item (1)
  \item Item (2)
  \item Item (3)
\end{enumerate}
```

Note that `\part` must be present in the TeX document (at least for now) regardless of whether it actually has parts; this can be an empty `\part{}` if parts are not intended to be used.

## build_all_draft.sh and build_all_final.sh

For convenience, two bash scripts are provided to compile multiple documents.

Put documents that are divided into parts into a subdirectory called `part` and documents that are divided into sections into a subdirectory called `section`. Files must use the Mediawiki syntax and must have the extension `.wik`.

The file name is taken from the file name of the .wik file, and the title of the document is taken from the first line of the .wik file.

`example_document.wik` with the contents

```
Document Title

=Heading Level 1=

Body.

==Heading Level 2==

* Unordered list item

===Heading Level 3===

# Ordered list item

```

will produce `example_document.html`

## Setting up on OS X

This works for getting the Python script running in OS X El Capitan (10.11.6). More efficient/appropriate steps may exist, but this _worked_.

1. Install [TeX](http://tug.org/mactex/).
2. Install [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
3. Launch Terminal.
4. Install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh)
5. Install [Pandoc](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases/tag/1.17.2) with `brew install pandoc`.
6. Install [Libxml2](http://xmlsoft.org/index.html) with `brew install libxml2`.
7. Install [Libxslt](http://xmlsoft.org/libxslt/) with `brew install libxslt`.
8. Run `link libxml2 --force`.
9. Run `link libxslt --force`.
10. Install [lxml](http://lxml.de) with `pip install lxml`.
11. Install [Roman](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/roman) with `pip install Roman`.
12. Install [cssselect](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cssselect) with `pip install cssselect`.

- First, you need to add cydia repository
    - http://cydia.radare.org
    - from this repo install libgcc
    - (this repo is **not** for cracked app but for developer)
- And install terminal.app or OpenSSH and Apt7

on iOS
~~~
$ sudo apt-get install ldid libgcc
$ sudo apt-get install make python coreutils inetutils git 
$ git clone git@github.com:haya14busa/ios-build
$ sudo mv /usr/bin/gcc /usr/bin/realgcc
$ sudo mv /usr/bin/arch /usr/bin/realarch
$ cd ios-build
$ chmod +x gcc arch
$ sudo cp gcc /usr/bin/
$ sudo cp arch /usr/bin/
$ sudo ln -s /usr/bin/gcc /usr/bin/cc
$ sudo ldid -S /usr/bin/gcc
$ sudo ldid -S /usr/bin/arch
~~~

Now you can use ./configure or make so compile anything you want!

.NET technology stack, including frameworks, SDKs, tools etc

![Image of The Dot NET Stack](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/unruledboy/DotNetStack/master/preview.png)

# What and why?
Have you ever wondered:
* what technologies .NET really includes? 
* how many do I possess?


I could not find a really comprehensive diagram that shows the .NET technology stack, so I come up with my own version.

There might be issues here and there, like the category, the individual ones, but the beautity is you can modify it as you want.


You can have a graphical preview here (use mouse to move / zoom):

## Description

This is an experimental investigation technique using the a GitHub repository and and the Bitcoin blockchain to conduct an investigation on [Moolah.io](https://moolah.io/).  

Take note this is a slow and exact process and not summary justice. I am not a qualified lawyer or criminal investigator, I am just a concerned member of the Bitcoin community who wants to see truth and justice.  

There are postings online which link to information including personal identifiable information on individuals who’s guilt or innocence is still unknown and yet the revealing of such information could put them and their families at risk were that information to fall in to the hands who show more care to emotional reactions than to the principles of justice.  

The methods used are still very new but the intention is to create an unbreakable record of witnessed events which are timestamped in to the Bitcoin blockchain and identified using their cryptographic digests in the git repository.  

Nothing contained in this repo should be considered final or proof of guilt of any party whatsoever as this it is too early rely on this technology as legal proofs. However if you would what you see you are encouraged to get involved and put in some pull requests with any information you may have regarding the distrusted crypto currency exchange.  

Please feel free to send in your suggestions or criticisms on the techniques employed.

## Introduction

Here are some of the documents from Apple that informed the style guide. If something isn't mentioned here, it's probably covered in great detail in one of these:

* [Cocoa Fundamentals Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CocoaFundamentals/Introduction/Introduction.html)
* [Coding Guidelines for Cocoa](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CodingGuidelines/CodingGuidelines.html)
* [iOS App Programming Guide](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/iphone/conceptual/iphoneosprogrammingguide/Introduction/Introduction.html)

## Dot-Notation Syntax

Dot-notation should **always** be used for accessing and mutating properties. Bracket notation is preferred in all other instances.

**For example:**
```objc
view.backgroundColor = [UIColor orangeColor];
[UIApplication sharedApplication].delegate;
```

**Not:**
```objc
[view setBackgroundColor:[UIColor orangeColor]];
UIApplication.sharedApplication.delegate;
```

## Spacing

* Indent using 4 spaces. Never indent with tabs. Be sure to set this preference in Xcode.
* Method braces and other braces (`if`/`else`/`switch`/`while` etc.) always open on the same line as the statement but close on a new line.

**For example:**
```objc
if (user.isHappy) {
//Do something
}
else {
//Do something else
}
```
* There should be exactly one blank line between methods to aid in visual clarity and organization. Whitespace within methods should separate functionality, but often there should probably be new methods.
* `@synthesize` and `@dynamic` should each be declared on new lines in the implementation.

## Conditionals

Conditional bodies should always use braces even when a conditional body could be written without braces (e.g., it is one line only) to prevent [errors](https://github.com/NYTimes/objective-c-style-guide/issues/26#issuecomment-22074256). These errors include adding a second line and expecting it to be part of the if-statement. Another, [even more dangerous defect](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/a/16530) may happen where the line ""inside"" the if-statement is commented out, and the next line unwittingly becomes part of the if-statement. In addition, this style is more consistent with all other conditionals, and therefore more easily scannable.

**For example:**
```objc
if (!error) {
    return success;
}
```

**Not:**
```objc
if (!error)
    return success;
```

or

```objc
if (!error) return success;
```

### Ternary Operator

The Ternary operator, ? , should only be used when it increases clarity or code neatness. A single condition is usually all that should be evaluated. Evaluating multiple conditions is usually more understandable as an if statement, or refactored into instance variables.

**For example:**
```objc
result = a > b ? x : y;
```

**Not:**
```objc
result = a > b ? x = c > d ? c : d : y;
```

## Error handling

When methods return an error parameter by reference, switch on the returned value, not the error variable.

**For example:**
```objc
NSError *error;
if (![self trySomethingWithError:&error]) {
    // Handle Error
}
```

**Not:**
```objc
NSError *error;
[self trySomethingWithError:&error];
if (error) {
    // Handle Error
}
```

Some of Apple’s APIs write garbage values to the error parameter (if non-NULL) in successful cases, so switching on the error can cause false negatives (and subsequently crash).

## Methods

In method signatures, there should be a space after the scope (-/+ symbol). There should be a space between the method segments.

**For Example**:
```objc
- (void)setExampleText:(NSString *)text image:(UIImage *)image;
```
## Variables

Variables should be named as descriptively as possible. Single letter variable names should be avoided except in `for()` loops.

Asterisks indicating pointers belong with the variable, e.g., `NSString *text` not `NSString* text` or `NSString * text`, except in the case of constants.

Property definitions should be used in place of naked instance variables whenever possible. Direct instance variable access should be avoided except in initializer methods (`init`, `initWithCoder:`, etc…), `dealloc` methods and within custom setters and getters. For more information on using Accessor Methods in Initializer Methods and dealloc, see [here](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/MemoryMgmt/Articles/mmPractical.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004447-SW6).

**For example:**

```objc
@interface NYTSection: NSObject

@property (nonatomic) NSString *headline;

@end
```

**Not:**

```objc
@interface NYTSection : NSObject {
    NSString *headline;
}
```

#### Variable Qualifiers

When it comes to the variable qualifiers [introduced with ARC](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/releasenotes/objectivec/rn-transitioningtoarc/Introduction/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40011226-CH1-SW4), the qualifier (`__strong`, `__weak`, `__unsafe_unretained`, `__autoreleasing`) should be placed between the asterisks and the variable name, e.g., `NSString * __weak text`. 

## Naming

Apple naming conventions should be adhered to wherever possible, especially those related to [memory management rules](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/MemoryMgmt/Articles/MemoryMgmt.html) ([NARC](http://stackoverflow.com/a/2865194/340508)).

Long, descriptive method and variable names are good.

**For example:**

```objc
UIButton *settingsButton;
```

**Not**

```objc
UIButton *setBut;
```

A three letter prefix (e.g. `NYT`) should always be used for class names and constants, however may be omitted for Core Data entity names. Constants should be camel-case with all words capitalized and prefixed by the related class name for clarity.

**For example:**

```objc
static const NSTimeInterval NYTArticleViewControllerNavigationFadeAnimationDuration = 0.3;
```

**Not:**

```objc
static const NSTimeInterval fadetime = 1.7;
```

Properties and local variables should be camel-case with the leading word being lowercase.

Instance variables should be camel-case with the leading word being lowercase, and should be prefixed with an underscore. This is consistent with instance variables synthesized automatically by LLVM. **If LLVM can synthesize the variable automatically, then let it.**

**For example:**

```objc
@synthesize descriptiveVariableName = _descriptiveVariableName;
```

**Not:**

```objc
id varnm;
```

## Comments

When they are needed, comments should be used to explain **why** a particular piece of code does something. Any comments that are used must be kept up-to-date or deleted.

Block comments should generally be avoided, as code should be as self-documenting as possible, with only the need for intermittent, few-line explanations. This does not apply to those comments used to generate documentation.

## init and dealloc

`dealloc` methods should be placed at the top of the implementation, directly after the `@synthesize` and `@dynamic` statements. `init` should be placed directly below the `dealloc` methods of any class.

`init` methods should be structured like this:

```objc
- (instancetype)init {
    self = [super init]; // or call the designated initializer
    if (self) {
        // Custom initialization
    }

    return self;
}
```

## Literals

`NSString`, `NSDictionary`, `NSArray`, and `NSNumber` literals should be used whenever creating immutable instances of those objects. Pay special care that `nil` values not be passed into `NSArray` and `NSDictionary` literals, as this will cause a crash.

**For example:**

```objc
NSArray *names = @[@""Brian"", @""Matt"", @""Chris"", @""Alex"", @""Steve"", @""Paul""];
NSDictionary *productManagers = @{@""iPhone"" : @""Kate"", @""iPad"" : @""Kamal"", @""Mobile Web"" : @""Bill""};
NSNumber *shouldUseLiterals = @YES;
NSNumber *buildingZIPCode = @10018;
```

**Not:**

```objc
NSArray *names = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:@""Brian"", @""Matt"", @""Chris"", @""Alex"", @""Steve"", @""Paul"", nil];
NSDictionary *productManagers = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys: @""Kate"", @""iPhone"", @""Kamal"", @""iPad"", @""Bill"", @""Mobile Web"", nil];
NSNumber *shouldUseLiterals = [NSNumber numberWithBool:YES];
NSNumber *buildingZIPCode = [NSNumber numberWithInteger:10018];
```

## CGRect Functions

When accessing the `x`, `y`, `width`, or `height` of a `CGRect`, always use the [`CGGeometry` functions](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/graphicsimaging/reference/CGGeometry/Reference/reference.html) instead of direct struct member access. From Apple's `CGGeometry` reference:

> All functions described in this reference that take CGRect data structures as inputs implicitly standardize those rectangles before calculating their results. For this reason, your applications should avoid directly reading and writing the data stored in the CGRect data structure. Instead, use the functions described here to manipulate rectangles and to retrieve their characteristics.

**For example:**

```objc
CGRect frame = self.view.frame;

CGFloat x = CGRectGetMinX(frame);
CGFloat y = CGRectGetMinY(frame);
CGFloat width = CGRectGetWidth(frame);
CGFloat height = CGRectGetHeight(frame);
```

**Not:**

```objc
CGRect frame = self.view.frame;

CGFloat x = frame.origin.x;
CGFloat y = frame.origin.y;
CGFloat width = frame.size.width;
CGFloat height = frame.size.height;
```

## Constants

Constants are preferred over in-line string literals or numbers, as they allow for easy reproduction of commonly used variables and can be quickly changed without the need for find and replace. Constants should be declared as `static` constants and not `#define`s unless explicitly being used as a macro.

**For example:**

```objc
static NSString * const NYTAboutViewControllerCompanyName = @""The New York Times Company"";

static const CGFloat NYTImageThumbnailHeight = 50.0;
```

**Not:**

```objc
#define CompanyName @""The New York Times Company""

#define thumbnailHeight 2
```

## Enumerated Types

When using `enum`s, it is recommended to use the new fixed underlying type specification because it has stronger type checking and code completion. The SDK now includes a macro to facilitate and encourage use of fixed underlying types — `NS_ENUM()`

**Example:**

```objc
typedef NS_ENUM(NSInteger, NYTAdRequestState) {
    NYTAdRequestStateInactive,
    NYTAdRequestStateLoading
};
```

## Bitmasks

When working with bitmasks, use the `NS_OPTIONS` macro.

**Example:**

```objc
typedef NS_OPTIONS(NSUInteger, NYTAdCategory) {
  NYTAdCategoryAutos      = 1 << 0,
  NYTAdCategoryJobs       = 1 << 1,
  NYTAdCategoryRealState  = 1 << 2,
  NYTAdCategoryTechnology = 1 << 3
};
```

## Private Properties

Private properties should be declared in class extensions (anonymous categories) in the implementation file of a class. Named categories (such as `NYTPrivate` or `private`) should never be used unless extending another class.

**For example:**

```objc
@interface NYTAdvertisement ()

@property (nonatomic, strong) GADBannerView *googleAdView;
@property (nonatomic, strong) ADBannerView *iAdView;
@property (nonatomic, strong) UIWebView *adXWebView;

@end
```

## Image Naming

Image names should be named consistently to preserve organization and developer sanity. They should be named as one camel case string with a description of their purpose, followed by the un-prefixed name of the class or property they are customizing (if there is one), followed by a further description of color and/or placement, and finally their state.

**For example:**

* `RefreshBarButtonItem` / `RefreshBarButtonItem@2x` and `RefreshBarButtonItemSelected` / `RefreshBarButtonItemSelected@2x`
* `ArticleNavigationBarWhite` / `ArticleNavigationBarWhite@2x` and `ArticleNavigationBarBlackSelected` / `ArticleNavigationBarBlackSelected@2x`.

Images that are used for a similar purpose should be grouped in respective groups in an Images folder.

## Booleans

Since `nil` resolves to `NO` it is unnecessary to compare it in conditions. Never compare something directly to `YES`, because `YES` is defined to 1 and a `BOOL` can be up to 8 bits.

This allows for more consistency across files and greater visual clarity.

**For example:**

```objc
if (!someObject) {
}
```

**Not:**

```objc
if (someObject == nil) {
}
```

-----

**For a `BOOL`, here are two examples:**

```objc
if (isAwesome)
if (![someObject boolValue])
```

**Not:**

```objc
if (isAwesome == YES) // Never do this.
if ([someObject boolValue] == NO)
```

-----

If the name of a `BOOL` property is expressed as an adjective, the property can omit the “is” prefix but specifies the conventional name for the get accessor, for example:

```objc
@property (assign, getter=isEditable) BOOL editable;
```
Text and example taken from the [Cocoa Naming Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CodingGuidelines/Articles/NamingIvarsAndTypes.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001284-BAJGIIJE).

## Singletons

Singleton objects should use a thread-safe pattern for creating their shared instance.
```objc
+ (instancetype)sharedInstance {
   static id sharedInstance = nil;

   static dispatch_once_t onceToken;
   dispatch_once(&onceToken, ^{
      sharedInstance = [[self alloc] init];
   });

   return sharedInstance;
}
```
This will prevent [possible and sometimes prolific crashes](http://cocoasamurai.blogspot.com/2011/04/singletons-your-doing-them-wrong.html).

## Imports

If there is more than one import statement, group the statements [together](http://ashfurrow.com/blog/structuring-modern-objective-c). Commenting each group is optional.

Note: For modules use the [@import](http://clang.llvm.org/docs/Modules.html#using-modules) syntax.

```objc
// Frameworks
@import QuartzCore;

// Models
#import ""NYTUser.h""

// Views
#import ""NYTButton.h""
#import ""NYTUserView.h""
```

## Xcode project

The physical files should be kept in sync with the Xcode project files in order to avoid file sprawl. Any Xcode groups created should be reflected by folders in the filesystem. Code should be grouped not only by type, but also by feature for greater clarity.

When possible, always turn on ""Treat Warnings as Errors"" in the target's Build Settings and enable as many [additional warnings](http://boredzo.org/blog/archives/2009-11-07/warnings) as possible. If you need to ignore a specific warning, use [Clang's pragma feature](http://clang.llvm.org/docs/UsersManual.html#controlling-diagnostics-via-pragmas).

Community forming at [Google Group ""learnds""](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/learnds)

What
----

* A collection of Data Science Learning materials in the form of IPython Notebooks.
* Associated data sets.

The initial beta release consists of four major topics

* Linear Regression
* Logistic Regression
* Random Forests
* K-Means Clustering

Each of the above has at least three IPython Notebooks covering

* Overview (an exposition of the technique for the math-wary)
* Data Exploration (the nuts and bolts of real world data wrangling)
* Analysis (using the technique to get results)

One or more of these may have supplementary material.
Each of these have worksheets that contain mostly the code sections so you can iteratively explore the code.

Three openly available data sets are used.  

* For the Linear and Logistic Regression we use a data set on loans and interest rates provided by Learning Club http://learningclub.com  
* For Random Forests we use a data set of Android accelerometer and gyroscope readings used to predict body position and motion from the Human Activity Recognition project
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
* UN data on economic indicators of countries

Why
---

There's a need for open content to raise the level of awareness and training in basics, in the Data Science
field (circa early 2013).

IPython Notebook provides an appropriate platform for rapid iterative exploration and learning.

When
----

Starting in 2013 and intended to extend for a long while.

Background  
----------

If you are unfamiliar with IPython Notebook you can start with http://ipython.org/notebook


Installation  
------------

* Prerequisites  
One of the following distributions is needed. Please note that even if you have Python installed it is important to have one of these distributions installed and the binary for this installation in your path. This is because these distributions come packaged with all the supplementary libraries needed and these have been historically difficult to install separately.

  * EPD Free Enthought Python Distribution from http://enthought.com
  * Anaconda Python from http://continuum.io
  * Development has been done on v 1.5 of Anaconda distribution but EPD Free should work just as well.

* The following steps assume you have installed one of the distributions mentioned in prerequisites.

* From a zip or tar file
    * download the zip or tar file 
    * unpack the file to a directory called learnds
    * cd to the 'notebooks' subdirectory
    * start IPython Notebook 'ipython notebook --pylab=inline'
 
* From the git repo
    * clone the repo
    * cd to 'notebooks'
    * start IPython Notebook 'ipython notebook --pylab=inline'

===========

This is a guide for anyone who needs to share data with a statistician. The target audiences I have in mind are:

* Scientific collaborators who need statisticians to analyze data for them
* Students or postdocs in scientific disciplines looking for consulting advice
* Junior statistics students whose job it is to collate/clean data sets

The goals of this guide are to provide some instruction on the best way to share data to avoid the most common pitfalls
and sources of delay in the transition from data collection to data analysis. The [Leek group](http://biostat.jhsph.edu/~jleek/) works with a large
number of collaborators and the number one source of variation in the speed to results is the status of the data
when they arrive at the Leek group. Based on my conversations with other statisticians this is true nearly universally.

My strong feeling is that statisticians should be able to handle the data in whatever state they arrive. It is important
to see the raw data, understand the steps in the processing pipeline, and be able to incorporate hidden sources of
variability in one's data analysis. On the other hand, for many data types, the processing steps are well documented
and standardized. So the work of converting the data from raw form to directly analyzable form can be performed 
before calling on a statistician. This can dramatically speed the turnaround time, since the statistician doesn't
have to work through all the pre-processing steps first. 


What you should deliver to the statistician
====================

For maximum speed in the analysis this is the information you should pass to a statistician:

1. The raw data.
2. A [tidy data set](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf) 
3. A code book describing each variable and its values in the tidy data set.  
4. An explicit and exact recipe you used to go from 1 -> 2,3 

Let's look at each part of the data package you will transfer. 


### The raw data

It is critical that you include the rawest form of the data that you have access to. Here are some examples of the
raw form of data:

* The strange [binary file](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_file) your measurement machine spits out
* The unformatted Excel file with 10 worksheets the company you contracted with sent you
* The complicated [JSON](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) data you got from scraping the [Twitter API](https://twitter.com/twitterapi)
* The hand-entered numbers you collected looking through a microscope

You know the raw data is in the right format if you: 

1. Ran no software on the data
1. Did not manipulate any of the numbers in the data
1. You did not remove any data from the data set
1. You did not summarize the data in any way

If you did any manipulation of the data at all it is not the raw form of the data. Reporting manipulated data
as raw data is a very common way to slow down the analysis process, since the analyst will often have to do a
forensic study of your data to figure out why the raw data looks weird. 

### The tidy data set

The general principles of tidy data are laid out by [Hadley Wickham](http://had.co.nz/) in [this paper](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf)
and [this video](http://vimeo.com/33727555). The paper and the video are both focused on the [R](http://www.r-project.org/) package, which you
may or may not know how to use. Regardless the four general principles you should pay attention to are:

1. Each variable you measure should be in one column
1. Each different observation of that variable should be in a different row
1. There should be one table for each ""kind"" of variable
1. If you have multiple tables, they should include a column in the table that allows them to be linked

While these are the hard and fast rules, there are a number of other things that will make your data set much easier
to handle. First is to include a row at the top of each data table/spreadsheet that contains full row names. 
So if you measured age at diagnosis for patients, you would head that column with the name `AgeAtDiagnosis` instead
of something like `ADx` or another abbreviation that may be hard for another person to understand. 


Here is an example of how this would work from genomics. Suppose that for 20 people you have collected gene expression measurements with 
[RNA-sequencing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA-Seq). You have also collected demographic and clinical information
about the patients including their age, treatment, and diagnosis. You would have one table/spreadsheet that contains the clinical/demographic
information. It would have four columns (patient id, age, treatment, diagnosis) and 21 rows (a row with variable names, then one row
for every patient). You would also have one spreadsheet for the summarized genomic data. Usually this type of data
is summarized at the level of the number of counts per exon. Suppose you have 100,000 exons, then you would have a
table/spreadsheet that had 21 rows (a row for gene names, and one row for each patient) and 100,001 columns (one row for patient
ids and one row for each data type). 

If you are sharing your data with the collaborator in Excel, the tidy data should be in one Excel file per table. They
should not have multiple worksheets, no macros should be applied to the data, and no columns/cells should be highlighted. 
Alternatively share the data in a [CSV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) or [TAB-delimited](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tab-separated_values) text file.


### The code book

For almost any data set, the measurements you calculate will need to be described in more detail than you will sneak
into the spreadsheet. The code book contains this information. At minimum it should contain:

1. Information about the variables (including units!) in the data set not contained in the tidy data 
1. Information about the summary choices you made
1. Information about the experimental study design you used

In our genomics example, the analyst would want to know what the unit of measurement for each
clinical/demographic variable is (age in years, treatment by name/dose, level of diagnosis and how heterogeneous). They 
would also want to know how you picked the exons you used for summarizing the genomic data (UCSC/Ensembl, etc.). They
would also want to know any other information about how you did the data collection/study design. For example,
are these the first 20 patients that walked into the clinic? Are they 20 highly selected patients by some characteristic
like age? Are they randomized to treatments? 

A common format for this document is a Word file. There should be a section called ""Study design"" that has a thorough
description of how you collected the data. There is a section called ""Code book"" that describes each variable and its
units. 

### How to code variables

When you put variables into a spreadsheet there are several main categories you will run into depending on their [data type](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_data_type):

1. Continuous
1. Ordinal
1. Categorical
1. Missing 
1. Censored

Continuous variables are anything measured on a quantitative scale that could be any fractional number. An example
would be something like weight measured in kg. [Ordinal data](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_data) are data that have a fixed, small (< 100) number of levels but are ordered. 
This could be for example survey responses where the choices are: poor, fair, good. [Categorical data](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_variable) are data where there
are multiple categories, but they aren't ordered. One example would be sex: male or female. [Missing data](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_data) are data
that are missing and you don't know the mechanism. You should code missing values as `NA`. [Censored data](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censoring_(statistics\)) are data
where you know the missingness mechanism on some level. Common examples are a measurement being below a detection limit
or a patient being lost to follow-up. They should also be coded as `NA` when you don't have the data. But you should
also add a new column to your tidy data called, ""VariableNameCensored"" which should have values of `TRUE` if censored 
and `FALSE` if not. In the code book you should explain why those values are missing. It is absolutely critical to report
to the analyst if there is a reason you know about that some of the data are missing. You should also not [impute](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imputation_(statistics\))/make up/
throw away missing observations.

In general, try to avoid coding categorical or ordinal variables as numbers. When you enter the value for sex in the tidy
data, it should be ""male"" or ""female"". The ordinal values in the data set should be ""poor"", ""fair"", and ""good"" not 1, 2 ,3.
This will avoid potential mixups about which direction effects go and will help identify coding errors. 

Always encode every piece of information about your observations using text. For example, if you are storing data in Excel and use a form of colored text or cell background formatting to indicate information about an observation (""red variable entries were observed in experiment 1."") then this information will not be exported (and will be lost!) when the data is exported as raw text.  Every piece of data should be encoded as actual text that can be exported.  

### The instruction list/script

You may have heard this before, but [reproducibility is kind of a big deal in computational science](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/334/6060/1226).
That means, when you submit your paper, the reviewers and the rest of the world should be able to exactly replicate
the analyses from raw data all the way to final results. If you are trying to be efficient, you will likely perform
some summarization/data analysis steps before the data can be considered tidy. 

The ideal thing for you to do when performing summarization is to create a computer script (in `R`, `Python`, or something else) 
that takes the raw data as input and produces the tidy data you are sharing as output. You can try running your script
a couple of times and see if the code produces the same output. 

In many cases, the person who collected the data has incentive to make it tidy for a statistician to speed the process
of collaboration. They may not know how to code in a scripting language. In that case, what you should provide the statistician
is something called [pseudocode](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocode). It should look something like:

1. Step 1 - take the raw file, run version 3.1.2 of summarize software with parameters a=1, b=2, c=3
1. Step 2 - run the software separately for each sample
1. Step 3 - take column three of outputfile.out for each sample and that is the corresponding row in the output data set

You should also include information about which system (Mac/Windows/Linux) you used the software on and whether you 
tried it more than once to confirm it gave the same results. Ideally, you will run this by a fellow student/labmate
to confirm that they can obtain the same output file you did. 




What you should expect from the analyst
====================

When you turn over a properly tidied data set it dramatically decreases the workload on the statistician. So hopefully
they will get back to you much sooner. But most careful statisticians will check your recipe, ask questions about
steps you performed, and try to confirm that they can obtain the same tidy data that you did with, at minimum, spot
checks.

You should then expect from the statistician:

1. An analysis script that performs each of the analyses (not just instructions)
1. The exact computer code they used to run the analysis
1. All output files/figures they generated. 

This is the information you will use in the supplement to establish reproducibility and precision of your results. Each
of the steps in the analysis should be clearly explained and you should ask questions when you don't understand
what the analyst did. It is the responsibility of both the statistician and the scientist to understand the statistical
analysis. You may not be able to perform the exact analyses without the statistician's code, but you should be able
to explain why the statistician performed each step to a labmate/your principal investigator.

Fluency on the command line is a skill often neglected or considered arcane, but it improves your flexibility and productivity as an engineer in both obvious and subtle ways. This is a selection of notes and tips on using the command-line that we've found useful when working on Linux. Some tips are elementary, and some are fairly specific, sophisticated, or obscure. This page is not long, but if you can use and recall all the items here, you know a lot.

This work is the result of [many authors and translators](AUTHORS.md).
Much of this
[originally](http://www.quora.com/What-are-some-lesser-known-but-useful-Unix-commands)
[appeared](http://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-useful-Swiss-army-knife-one-liners-on-Unix)
on [Quora](http://www.quora.com/What-are-some-time-saving-tips-that-every-Linux-user-should-know),
but given the interest there, it seemed worth using GitHub, where people more talented than the original author could readily suggest improvements. If you see an error or something that could be better, please submit an issue or PR! (Of course please review the meta section and existing PRs/issues first.)


## Meta

Scope:

- This guide is both for beginners and the experienced. The goals are *breadth* (everything important), *specificity* (give concrete examples of the most common case), and *brevity* (avoid things that aren't essential or digressions you can easily look up elsewhere). Every tip is essential in some situation or significantly saves time over alternatives.
- This is written for Linux, with the exception of the ""[MacOS X only](#macos-x-only)"" section. Many of the other items apply or can be installed on other Unices or MacOS (or even Cygwin).
- The focus is on interactive Bash, though many tips apply to other shells and to general Bash scripting.
- It includes both ""standard"" Unix commands as well as ones that require special package installs -- so long as they are important enough to merit inclusion.

Notes:

- To keep this to one page, content is implicitly included by reference. You're smart enough to look up more detail elsewhere once you know the idea or command to Google. Use `apt-get`/`yum`/`dnf`/`pacman`/`pip`/`brew` (as appropriate) to install new programs.
- Use [Explainshell](http://explainshell.com/) to get a helpful breakdown of what commands, options, pipes etc. do.


## Basics

- Learn basic Bash. Actually, type `man bash` and at least skim the whole thing; it's pretty easy to follow and not that long. Alternate shells can be nice, but Bash is powerful and always available (learning *only* zsh, fish, etc., while tempting on your own laptop, restricts you in many situations, such as using existing servers).

- Learn at least one text-based editor well. Ideally Vim (`vi`), as there's really no competition for random editing in a terminal (even if you use Emacs, a big IDE, or a modern hipster editor most of the time).

- Know how to read documentation with `man` (for the inquisitive, `man man` lists the section numbers, e.g. 1 is ""regular"" commands, 5 is files/conventions, and 8 are for administration). Find man pages with `apropos`. Know that some commands are not executables, but Bash builtins, and that you can get help on them with `help` and `help -d`.

- Learn about redirection of output and input using `>` and `<` and pipes using `|`. Know `>` overwrites the output file and `>>` appends. Learn about stdout and stderr.

- Learn about file glob expansion with `*` (and perhaps `?` and `[`...`]`) and quoting and the difference between double `""` and single `'` quotes. (See more on variable expansion below.)

- Be familiar with Bash job management: `&`, **ctrl-z**, **ctrl-c**, `jobs`, `fg`, `bg`, `kill`, etc.

- Know `ssh`, and the basics of passwordless authentication, via `ssh-agent`, `ssh-add`, etc.

- Basic file management: `ls` and `ls -l` (in particular, learn what every column in `ls -l` means), `less`, `head`, `tail` and `tail -f` (or even better, `less +F`), `ln` and `ln -s` (learn the differences and advantages of hard versus soft links), `chown`, `chmod`, `du` (for a quick summary of disk usage: `du -hs *`). For filesystem management, `df`, `mount`, `fdisk`, `mkfs`, `lsblk`. Learn what an inode is (`ls -i` or `df -i`).

- Basic network management: `ip` or `ifconfig`, `dig`.

- Know regular expressions well, and the various flags to `grep`/`egrep`. The `-i`, `-o`, `-v`, `-A`, `-B`, and `-C` options are worth knowing.

- Learn to use `apt-get`, `yum`, `dnf` or `pacman` (depending on distro) to find and install packages. And make sure you have `pip` to install Python-based command-line tools (a few below are easiest to install via `pip`).


## Everyday use

- In Bash, use **Tab** to complete arguments or list all available commands and **ctrl-r** to search through command history (after pressing, type to search, press **ctrl-r** repeatedly to cycle through more matches, press **Enter** to execute the found command, or hit the right arrow to put the result in the current line to allow editing).

- In Bash, use **ctrl-w** to delete the last word, and **ctrl-u** to delete all the way back to the start of the line. Use **alt-b** and **alt-f** to move by word, **ctrl-a** to move cursor to beginning of line,  **ctrl-e** to move cursor to end of line, **ctrl-k** to kill to the end of the line, **ctrl-l** to clear the screen. See `man readline` for all the default keybindings in Bash. There are a lot. For example **alt-.** cycles through previous arguments, and **alt-*** expands a glob.


- Alternatively, if you love vi-style key-bindings, use `set -o vi` (and `set -o emacs` to put it back).

- For editing long commands, after setting your editor (for example `export EDITOR=vim`), **ctrl-x** **ctrl-e** will open the current command in an editor for multi-line editing. Or in vi style, **escape-v**.

- To see recent commands, `history`. There are also many abbreviations such as `!$` (last argument) and `!!` last command, though these are often easily replaced with **ctrl-r** and **alt-.**.

- To go back to the previous working directory: `cd -`

- If you are halfway through typing a command but change your mind, hit **alt-#** to add a `#` at the beginning and enter it as a comment (or use **ctrl-a**, **#**, **enter**). You can then return to it later via command history.

- Use `xargs` (or `parallel`). It's very powerful. Note you can control how many items execute per line (`-L`) as well as parallelism (`-P`). If you're not sure if it'll do the right thing, use `xargs echo` first. Also, `-I{}` is handy. Examples:
```bash
      find . -name '*.py' | xargs grep some_function
      cat hosts | xargs -I{} ssh root@{} hostname
```

- `pstree -p` is a helpful display of the process tree.

- Use `pgrep` and `pkill` to find or signal processes by name (`-f` is helpful).

- Know the various signals you can send processes. For example, to suspend a process, use `kill -STOP [pid]`. For the full list, see `man 7 signal`

- Use `nohup` or `disown` if you want a background process to keep running forever.

- Check what processes are listening via `netstat -lntp` or `ss -plat` (for TCP; add `-u` for UDP).

- See also `lsof` for open sockets and files.

- See `uptime` or `w` to know the how long the system has been running.

- Use `alias` to create shortcuts for commonly used commands. For example, `alias ll='ls -latr'` creates a new alias `ll`.

- In Bash scripts, use `set -x` (or the variant `set -v`, which logs raw input, including unexpanded variables and comments) for debugging output. Use strict modes unless you have a good reason not to: Use `set -e` to abort on errors (nonzero exit code). Use `set -u` to detect unset variable usages. Consider `set -o pipefail` too, to on errors within pipes, too (though read up on it more if you do, as this topic is a bit subtle). For more involved scripts, also use `trap` on EXIT or ERR. A useful habit is to start a script like this, which will make it detect and abort on common errors and print a message:
```bash
      set -euo pipefail
      trap ""echo 'error: Script failed: see failed command above'"" ERR
```

- In Bash scripts, subshells (written with parentheses) are convenient ways to group commands. A common example is to temporarily move to a different working directory, e.g.
```bash
      # do something in current dir
      (cd /some/other/dir && other-command)
      # continue in original dir
```

- In Bash, note there are lots of kinds of variable expansion. Checking a variable exists: `${name:?error message}`. For example, if a Bash script requires a single argument, just write `input_file=${1:?usage: $0 input_file}`. Arithmetic expansion: `i=$(( (i + 1) % 5 ))`. Sequences: `{1..10}`. Trimming of strings: `${var%suffix}` and `${var#prefix}`. For example if `var=foo.pdf`, then `echo ${var%.pdf}.txt` prints `foo.txt`.

- Brace expansion using `{`...`}` can reduce having to re-type similar text and automate combinations of items.  This is helpful in examples like `mv foo.{txt,pdf} some-dir` (which moves both files), `cp somefile{,.bak}` (which expands to `cp somefile somefile.bak`) or `mkdir -p test-{a,b,c}/subtest-{1,2,3}` (which expands all possible combinations and creates a directory tree).

- The output of a command can be treated like a file via `<(some command)`. For example, compare local `/etc/hosts` with a remote one:
```sh
      diff /etc/hosts <(ssh somehost cat /etc/hosts)
```

- Know about ""here documents"" in Bash, as in `cat <<EOF ...`.

- In Bash, redirect both standard output and standard error via: `some-command >logfile 2>&1` or `some-command &>logfile`. Often, to ensure a command does not leave an open file handle to standard input, tying it to the terminal you are in, it is also good practice to add `</dev/null`.

- Use `man ascii` for a good ASCII table, with hex and decimal values. For general encoding info, `man unicode`, `man utf-8`, and `man latin1` are helpful.

- Use `screen` or [`tmux`](https://tmux.github.io/) to multiplex the screen, especially useful on remote ssh sessions and to detach and re-attach to a session. `byobu` can enhance screen or tmux providing more information and easier management. A more minimal alternative for session persistence only is `dtach`.

- In ssh, knowing how to port tunnel with `-L` or `-D` (and occasionally `-R`) is useful, e.g. to access web sites from a remote server.

- It can be useful to make a few optimizations to your ssh configuration; for example, this `~/.ssh/config` contains settings to avoid dropped connections in certain network environments, uses compression (which is helpful with scp over low-bandwidth connections), and multiplex channels to the same server with a local control file:
```
      TCPKeepAlive=yes
      ServerAliveInterval=15
      ServerAliveCountMax=6
      Compression=yes
      ControlMaster auto
      ControlPath /tmp/%r@%h:%p
      ControlPersist yes
```

- A few other options relevant to ssh are security sensitive and should be enabled with care, e.g. per subnet or host or in trusted networks: `StrictHostKeyChecking=no`, `ForwardAgent=yes`

- Consider [`mosh`](https://mosh.mit.edu/) an alternative to ssh that uses UDP, avoiding dropped connections and adding convenience on the road (requires server-side setup).

- To get the permissions on a file in octal form, which is useful for system configuration but not available in `ls` and easy to bungle, use something like
```sh
      stat -c '%A %a %n' /etc/timezone
```

- For interactive selection of values from the output of another command, use [`percol`](https://github.com/mooz/percol) or [`fzf`](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf).

- For interaction with files based on the output of another command (like `git`), use `fpp` ([PathPicker](https://github.com/facebook/PathPicker)).

- For a simple web server for all files in the current directory (and subdirs), available to anyone on your network, use:
`python -m SimpleHTTPServer 7777` (for port 7777 and Python 2) and `python -m http.server 7777` (for port 7777 and Python 3).

- For running a command with privileges, use `sudo` (for root) or `sudo -u` (for another user). Use `su` or `sudo bash` to actually run a shell as that user. Use `su -` to simulate a fresh login as root or another user.


## Processing files and data

- To locate a file by name in the current directory, `find . -iname '*something*'` (or similar). To find a file anywhere by name, use `locate something` (but bear in mind `updatedb` may not have indexed recently created files).

- For general searching through source or data files (more advanced than `grep -r`), use [`ag`](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher).

- To convert HTML to text: `lynx -dump -stdin`

- For Markdown, HTML, and all kinds of document conversion, try [`pandoc`](http://pandoc.org/).

- If you must handle XML, `xmlstarlet` is old but good.

- For JSON, use [`jq`](http://stedolan.github.io/jq/).

- For YAML, use [`shyaml`](https://github.com/0k/shyaml).

- For Excel or CSV files, [csvkit](https://github.com/onyxfish/csvkit) provides `in2csv`, `csvcut`, `csvjoin`, `csvgrep`, etc.

- For Amazon S3, [`s3cmd`](https://github.com/s3tools/s3cmd) is convenient and [`s4cmd`](https://github.com/bloomreach/s4cmd) is faster. Amazon's [`aws`](https://github.com/aws/aws-cli) and the improved [`saws`](https://github.com/donnemartin/saws) are essential for other AWS-related tasks.

- Know about `sort` and `uniq`, including uniq's `-u` and `-d` options -- see one-liners below. See also `comm`.

- Know about `cut`, `paste`, and `join` to manipulate text files. Many people use `cut` but forget about `join`.

- Know about `wc` to count newlines (`-l`), characters (`-m`), words (`-w`) and bytes (`-c`).

- Know about `tee` to copy from stdin to a file and also to stdout, as in `ls -al | tee file.txt`.

- Know that locale affects a lot of command line tools in subtle ways, including sorting order (collation) and performance. Most Linux installations will set `LANG` or other locale variables to a local setting like US English. But be aware sorting will change if you change locale. And know i18n routines can make sort or other commands run *many times* slower. In some situations (such as the set operations or uniqueness operations below) you can safely ignore slow i18n routines entirely and use traditional byte-based sort order, using `export LC_ALL=C`.

- Know basic `awk` and `sed` for simple data munging. For example, summing all numbers in the third column of a text file: `awk '{ x += $3 } END { print x }'`. This is probably 3X faster and 3X shorter than equivalent Python.

- To replace all occurrences of a string in place, in one or more files:
```sh
      perl -pi.bak -e 's/old-string/new-string/g' my-files-*.txt
```

- To rename multiple files and/or search and replace within files, try [`repren`](https://github.com/jlevy/repren). (In some cases the `rename` command also allows multiple renames, but be careful as its functionality is not the same on all Linux distributions.)
```sh
      # Full rename of filenames, directories, and contents foo -> bar:
      repren --full --preserve-case --from foo --to bar .
      # Recover backup files whatever.bak -> whatever:
      repren --renames --from '(.*)\.bak' --to '\1' *.bak
      # Same as above, using rename, if available:
      rename 's/\.bak$//' *.bak
```

- As the man page says, `rsync` really is a fast and extraordinarily versatile file copying tool. It's known for synchronizing between machines but is equally useful locally. It also is among the [fastest ways](https://web.archive.org/web/20130929001850/http://linuxnote.net/jianingy/en/linux/a-fast-way-to-remove-huge-number-of-files.html) to delete large numbers of files:
```sh
mkdir empty && rsync -r --delete empty/ some-dir && rmdir some-dir
```

- Use `shuf` to shuffle or select random lines from a file.

- Know `sort`'s options. For numbers, use `-n`, or `-h` for handling human-readable numbers (e.g. from `du -h`). Know how keys work (`-t` and `-k`). In particular, watch out that you need to write `-k1,1` to sort by only the first field; `-k1` means sort according to the whole line. Stable sort (`sort -s`) can be useful. For example, to sort first by field 2, then secondarily by field 1, you can use `sort -k1,1 | sort -s -k2,2`.

- If you ever need to write a tab literal in a command line in Bash (e.g. for the -t argument to sort), press **ctrl-v** **[Tab]** or write `$'\t'` (the latter is better as you can copy/paste it).

- The standard tools for patching source code are `diff` and `patch`. See also `diffstat` for summary statistics of a diff and `sdiff` for a side-by-side diff. Note `diff -r` works for entire directories. Use `diff -r tree1 tree2 | diffstat` for a summary of changes. Use `vimdiff` to compare and edit files.

- For binary files, use `hd`, `hexdump` or `xxd` for simple hex dumps and `bvi` or `biew` for binary editing.

- Also for binary files, `strings` (plus `grep`, etc.) lets you find bits of text.

- For binary diffs (delta compression), use `xdelta3`.

- To convert text encodings, try `iconv`. Or `uconv` for more advanced use; it supports some advanced Unicode things. For example, this command lowercases and removes all accents (by expanding and dropping them):
```sh
      uconv -f utf-8 -t utf-8 -x '::Any-Lower; ::Any-NFD; [:Nonspacing Mark:] >; ::Any-NFC; ' < input.txt > output.txt
```

- To split files into pieces, see `split` (to split by size) and `csplit` (to split by a pattern).

- To manipulate date and time expressions, use `dateadd`, `datediff`, `strptime` etc. from [`dateutils`](http://www.fresse.org/dateutils/).

- Use `zless`, `zmore`, `zcat`, and `zgrep` to operate on compressed files.


## System debugging

- For web debugging, `curl` and `curl -I` are handy, or their `wget` equivalents, or the more modern [`httpie`](https://github.com/jkbrzt/httpie).

- To know current cpu/disk status, the classic tools are `top` (or the better `htop`), `iostat`, and `iotop`. Use `iostat -mxz 15` for basic CPU and detailed per-partition disk stats and performance insight.

- For network connection details, use `netstat` and `ss`.

- For a quick overview of what's happening on a system, `dstat` is especially useful. For broadest overview with details, use [`glances`](https://github.com/nicolargo/glances).

- To know memory status, run and understand the output of `free` and `vmstat`. In particular, be aware the ""cached"" value is memory held by the Linux kernel as file cache, so effectively counts toward the ""free"" value.

- Java system debugging is a different kettle of fish, but a simple trick on Oracle's and some other JVMs is that you can run `kill -3 <pid>` and a full stack trace and heap summary (including generational garbage collection details, which can be highly informative) will be dumped to stderr/logs. The JDK's `jps`, `jstat`, `jstack`, `jmap` are useful. [SJK tools](https://github.com/aragozin/jvm-tools) are more advanced.

- Use `mtr` as a better traceroute, to identify network issues.

- For looking at why a disk is full, `ncdu` saves time over the usual commands like `du -sh *`.

- To find which socket or process is using bandwidth, try `iftop` or `nethogs`.

- The `ab` tool (comes with Apache) is helpful for quick-and-dirty checking of web server performance. For more complex load testing, try `siege`.

- For more serious network debugging, `wireshark`, `tshark`, or `ngrep`.

- Know about `strace` and `ltrace`. These can be helpful if a program is failing, hanging, or crashing, and you don't know why, or if you want to get a general idea of performance. Note the profiling option (`-c`), and the ability to attach to a running process (`-p`).

- Know about `ldd` to check shared libraries etc.

- Know how to connect to a running process with `gdb` and get its stack traces.

- Use `/proc`. It's amazingly helpful sometimes when debugging live problems. Examples: `/proc/cpuinfo`, `/proc/meminfo`, `/proc/cmdline`, `/proc/xxx/cwd`, `/proc/xxx/exe`, `/proc/xxx/fd/`, `/proc/xxx/smaps` (where `xxx` is the process id or pid).

- When debugging why something went wrong in the past, `sar` can be very helpful. It shows historic statistics on CPU, memory, network, etc.

- For deeper systems and performance analyses, look at `stap` ([SystemTap](https://sourceware.org/systemtap/wiki)), [`perf`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perf_(Linux)), and [`sysdig`](https://github.com/draios/sysdig).

- Check what OS you're on with `uname` or `uname -a` (general Unix/kernel info) or `lsb_release -a` (Linux distro info).

- Use `dmesg` whenever something's acting really funny (it could be hardware or driver issues).


## One-liners

A few examples of piecing together commands:

- It is remarkably helpful sometimes that you can do set intersection, union, and difference of text files via `sort`/`uniq`. Suppose `a` and `b` are text files that are already uniqued. This is fast, and works on files of arbitrary size, up to many gigabytes. (Sort is not limited by memory, though you may need to use the `-T` option if `/tmp` is on a small root partition.) See also the note about `LC_ALL` above and `sort`'s `-u` option (left out for clarity below).
```sh
      cat a b | sort | uniq > c   # c is a union b
      cat a b | sort | uniq -d > c   # c is a intersect b
      cat a b b | sort | uniq -u > c   # c is set difference a - b
```

- Use `grep . *` to quickly examine the contents of all files in a directory (so each line is paired with the filename), or `head -100 *` (so each file has a heading). This can be useful for directories filled with config settings like those in `/sys`, `/proc`, `/etc`.


- Summing all numbers in the third column of a text file (this is probably 3X faster and 3X less code than equivalent Python):
```sh
      awk '{ x += $3 } END { print x }' myfile
```

- If want to see sizes/dates on a tree of files, this is like a recursive `ls -l` but is easier to read than `ls -lR`:
```sh
      find . -type f -ls
```

- Say you have a text file, like a web server log, and a certain value that appears on some lines, such as an `acct_id` parameter that is present in the URL. If you want a tally of how many requests for each `acct_id`:
```sh
      cat access.log | egrep -o 'acct_id=[0-9]+' | cut -d= -f2 | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
```

- To continuously monitor changes, use `watch`, e.g. check changes to files in a directory with `watch -d -n 2 'ls -rtlh | tail'` or to network settings while troubleshooting your wifi settings with `watch -d -n 2 ifconfig`.

- Run this function to get a random tip from this document (parses Markdown and extracts an item):
```sh
      function taocl() {
        curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jlevy/the-art-of-command-line/master/README.md |
          pandoc -f markdown -t html |
          xmlstarlet fo --html --dropdtd |
          xmlstarlet sel -t -v ""(html/body/ul/li[count(p)>0])[$RANDOM mod last()+1]"" |
          xmlstarlet unesc | fmt -80
      }
```

## MacOS X only

These are items relevant *only* on MacOS.

- Package management with `brew` (Homebrew) and/or `port` (MacPorts). These can be used to install on MacOS many of the above commands.

- Copy output of any command to a desktop app with `pbcopy` and paste input from one with `pbpaste`.

- To enable the Option key in Mac OS Terminal as an alt key (such as used in the commands above like **alt-b**, **alt-f**, etc.), open Preferences -> Profiles -> Keyboard and select ""Use Option as Meta key"".

- To open a file with a desktop app, use `open` or `open -a /Applications/Whatever.app`.

- Spotlight: Search files with `mdfind` and list metadata (such as photo EXIF info) with `mdls`.

- Be aware MacOS is based on BSD Unix, and many commands (for example `ps`, `ls`, `tail`, `awk`, `sed`) have many subtle variations from Linux, which is largely influenced by System V-style Unix and GNU tools. You can often tell the difference by noting a man page has the heading ""BSD General Commands Manual."" In some cases GNU versions can be installed, too (such as `gawk` and `gsed` for GNU awk and sed). If writing cross-platform Bash scripts, avoid such commands (for example, consider Python or `perl`) or test carefully.

- To get MacOS release information, use `sw_vers`.

Inspired by [Lumen](https://lumendatabase.org/topics/1) (*formerly Chilling Effects*) and [Google](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/dmca), this repo contains the text of DMCA takedown notices and counter-notices we've received here at GitHub. We publish them as they are received, with only personally identifiable information redacted.

####Why is this?
In short, we believe that transparency is a virtue. Chilling Effects explained it well in 2014 (no longer available online): ""We are excited about the new opportunities the Internet offers individuals to express their views . . . but concerned that not everyone feels the same way. Study to date suggests that cease and desist letters often silence Internet users, whether or not their claims have legal merit."" (About, ChillingEffects.org, Sept. 2014, licensed under [CC-BY-3.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/us/)). Similarly, we post takedown notices here to document their potential to ""chill"" speech.

####What does it mean if there's a notice posted here?
It only means that we received the notice on the indicated date. It does ***not*** mean that the takedown was unlawful or wrong. It does ***not*** mean that the user identified in the notice has done anything wrong. We post the notices only for informational purposes. We don't make or imply any judgment about the merit of the claims they make. You can draw your own conclusions.

Dream: live in a world where you can learn mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology and engineering from perfect open source books made for free by people who want to get famous to get better paying jobs.

This is just a wacky project idea right now, there is no implementation, nor business model.

Method: a crash between:

- Stack Overflow gamification
- GitHub-like pull requests. Not anyone can edit anything like Wikipedia madness, but you *can* make your own copy (fork), and a precise a suggestion.
- Wikipedia. Imagine if you could link up-votable application examples to the page of a Mathematics theorem.
- page rank-like algorithm for user reputation, including a per-tag reputation (which user knows more about mathematics?) and content recommendation (what are the best articles about a given subject?)

Very early stage prototype(s):

- <https://github.com/cirosantilli/free-books-django-raw>

## Intro

Consider a [Stack-Overflow]()-like Q&A website:

- there are questions and answers
- questions have tags, e.g. programming languages like `C`, `C++`, `Java`
- users have a reputation measure. If you upvote someone's question or answer, his reputation increases. You need 15 reputation to upvote someone.

But Stack Overflow's reputation system sucks because:

- it the living ultimate god of `C++` upvotes you, you get `10` reputation
- if the first-day newb of `Java` upvotes you, you also get `10` reputation

We want to improve Stack Overflow's simplistic linear reputation system to determine who is the user who knows the most about a given tag.

Fundamental requirement: a Google PageRank-like algorithm (Eigenvalue based) such that:

-   everyone has one reputation per tag
-   if someone with high rep on a given tag upvotes you, you get a lot of reputation on that tag. More than you would get from someone with low reputation on that tag.

Optional but very desirable requirements:

-   users can upvote tags on a given question to say: ""I agree that this question deserves this tag"".

    The vote of users with higher rep on the tag should count more.

-   each time you upvote the same given person, it has less positive impact on his reputation for that tag.

    This would counter voting fraud, e.g. of close groups of friends which upvote each other a lot.

Another problem this would solve: multiple site split silliness: <http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/271989/does-it-pay-to-spin-off-sites> Since there is no human moderation, only algorithms, splitting websites makes no sense.

## Extra problems

### Original research vs explanations

How to determine if something is ""original research"" or not?

E.g.: a genius discovers something and publishes it really badly explained.

Someone less intelligent comes, explains it better, and gets widely read.

Or someone who just posts a bunch of links to good sources.

### Post age

Post metrics on Stack Overflow also suck: the post with most upvotes goes up and that is it.

It would be cool to give a boost to recent posts that got lots of upvotes.

They can't beat the older ones in total upvotes, but the upvote rate is a strong indicator of quality.

Does Google consider post date?

- https://www.quora.com/When-Google-indexes-a-page-does-it-consider-that-pages-creation-date-when-it-comes-to-PR-computation

### User trusts user

It would be cool for a user to say: I trust this other user on given tags / all tags.

Maybe this is required. E.g., given a real network, a bot network could make an exact copy of it, and that should have the same reputation as the real one.

Such relations make per-user score of other users / posts even more important.

### Per user score of all other users

Rate how much one user likes other users based on his actions.

E.g.: someone who only upvotes C questions will give score 0 for someone with only Java questions.

### Tag duplicates

How to mark tags `java` and `Java` as being duplicates without moderators?

Possible solution: everyone can mark tags as duplicate.

Once you mark tags as duplicate, if you search for one, you will see both.

### Pull request disagreements

What happens if:

- the writter of an answer dies, and someone makes a great pull request to his answer with 1M upvotes?
- 50% of users agree with a pull request, 50% don't?

Possible solution:

- next to each answer, have a list of forks
- everyone can mark an answer as the ""best version"" or just upvote the pull requests

## Testing: a difficulty

While it is possible to download all public data from Stack overflow in dumps, this algorithms would need private information like who upvoted what.

So generating meaningful test data would be a problem in itself.

### PageRank

Implementations:

-   https://github.com/louridas/pagerank C++
-   https://github.com/dcadenas/rankable_graph Ruby
-   https://github.com/dcadenas/pagerank/ Go, port of rankable_graph
-   https://github.com/frankmcsherry/pagerank

Mathematical problem: make a stochastic matrix graph where each entry equals:

- `(1 / n_links)` if there is a link going out
- `0` otherwise

Now calculate the steady state of the Markov process: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain#Steady-state_analysis_and_limiting_distributions> which is the same as calculating the eigenvector.

Convergence of simple interactive algorithm: stochastic link matrix M iff M is both: (TODO proof):

-   irreducible: definition: no strongly connected components smaller than the entire matrix. You can get from any place to any place.

    Or in other words, there are no sets of pages from which the surfer cannot escape. One example of this is a page without any outgoing links.

    http://drops.dagstuhl.de/volltexte/2007/1072/pdf/07071.VignaSebastiano.Paper.1072.pdf the damping factor can be interpreted as a probability that the random surfer will jump to a random page. It solves in particular the problem if the page has no outgoing links.

    If is the same as adding a `dumping_factor / total_n_pages` to every element of he matrix, and multiplying the actual matrix by `1 - damping_factor`.

    1 is always the largest eigenvalue http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/40320/proof-that-the-largest-eigenvalue-of-a-stochastic-matrix-is-1 wit Looks like 1 is the only eigenvalue: <http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/351142/why-markov-matrices-always-have-1-as-an-eigenvalue>

    Existence of a single largest real eigenvalue is guaranteed by https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perron–Frobenius_theorem

-   aperiodic <http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/112151/what-values-makes-this-markov-chain-aperiodic>

    Aperiodicity is likely for the huge graph of the web, so we forget about it.

Proposal to use it on Stack Overflow:

- http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/28874/applying-pagerank-like-algorithm-to-stack-overflow-votes

PageRank tutorials and papers:

- http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~chazelle/courses/BIB/pagerank.htm

PageRank alternatives:

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrustRank Starts from a set of trusted pages. Interesting, as that could be pages / users which were upvoted.
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HITS_algorithm separates author from referrer, which could be interesting to give more reputation to those who actually write material.
- https://www.nayuki.io/page/computing-wikipedias-internal-pageranks Wikipedia internal PageRanks, using a simple proprietary open-source Java PageRank implementation.

PageRank variants:

-   topic sensitive TODO understand better. Seems to modify the damping biasing to favour some pre-determined pages, on the paper based on DMOZ human consensus classification (no upvotes, just politics)
    - we could use something like that but based on votes of a given user, but it could be too expensive
    - http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~taherh/papers/topic-sensitive-pagerank.pdf Contains a great explanation of PageRank.
    - http://drops.dagstuhl.de/volltexte/2007/1072/pdf/07071.VignaSebastiano.Paper.1072.pdf
    - Seems to use an arbitrary previously fixed number of topics?

## Algorithm possibilities

The most obvious possibility is to reduce the problem to pagerank.

If we forget tags to simplify, we could do a bipartite authors / posts graph:

- each post and user is node in one side of the bipartite graph
- if userN upvotes postN, add a link from userN to postN
- link postN to it's author userN

To consider tags without weight, in addition:

- each user is represented by one node per tag userN-tagM
- if userN upvotes postN, add a link from userN-tagM to postN if postN is tagged with tagM
- link from postN to each userN-tagM where userN is the autor and tagM a tag of the post

## Tag hierarchy extraction

We could be able to deduce that `animal` includes `dog`, is a lot of articles tagged as 

- Tibeli 2013 http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0084133

## Websites with tag votes by any user

- Flickr 2016 only photo author can add tags
- Delicious TODO down?

## Datasets

## Business model

### Consulting

Start with consulting for universities to get some cash flowing.

Help teachers create perfect courses.

At the same time, develop the website, and use the generated content to bootstrap it.

Choose a domain of knowledge, generate perfect courses for it, and find all teachers of the domain in the world who are teaching that and help them out.

Then expand out to other domains.

TODO: which domain of knowledge should we go for? The more precise the better.

- maths is perfect because it ""never"" changes. But does not make money.
- computer science might be good, e.g. machine learning.

### Knowledge market

If enough people use it, we can let people sell courses through us, to become the YouTube of courses.

Teachers have the incentive of making open source to get more students.

Students pay when they want help to learn something.

### Who to propose this to

<https://catalogue.polytechnique.fr/cours.php?id=2913>

<http://psc.polytechnique.fr/>

### Ads

Possibly shared with top content producers, like Tsu.

Plus a paid option to opt out of ads.

But this is what YouTube does with videos, and it only pays for a ton of views...

## About this book

This is a book on the functional paradigm in general. We'll use the world's most popular functional programming language: JavaScript. Some may feel this is a poor choice as it's against the grain of the current culture which, at the moment, feels predominately imperative. However, I believe it is the best way to learn FP for several reasons:

 * **You likely use it every day at work.**

    This makes it possible to practice and apply your acquired knowledge each day on real world programs rather than pet projects on nights and weekends in an esoteric FP language.


 * **We don't have to learn everything up front to start writing programs.**

    In a pure functional language, you cannot log a variable or read a DOM node without using monads. Here we can cheat a little as we learn to purify our codebase. It's also easier to get started in this language since it's mixed paradigm and you can fall back on your current practices while there are gaps in your knowledge.


 * **The language is fully capable of writing top notch functional code.**

    We have all the features we need to mimic a language like Scala or Haskell with the help of a tiny library or two. Object-oriented programming currently dominates the industry, but it's clearly awkward in JavaScript. It's akin to camping off of a highway or tap dancing in galoshes. We have to `bind` all over the place lest `this` change out from under us, we don't have classes (yet), we have various work arounds for the quirky behavior when the `new` keyword is forgotten, private members are only available via closures. To a lot of us, FP feels more natural anyways.

That said, typed functional languages will, without a doubt, be the best place to code in the style presented by this book. JavaScript will be our means of learning a paradigm, where you apply it is up to you. Luckily, the interfaces are mathematical and, as such, ubiquitous. You'll find yourself at home with swiftz, scalaz, haskell, purescript, and other mathematically inclined environments.

# Plans for the future

* **Part 1** (currently chapters 1-7) is a guide to the basics. I'm updating as I find errors since this is the initial draft. Feel free to help!
* **Part 2** (currently chapters 8+) will address type classes like functors and monads all the way through to traversable. I hope to squeeze in transformers and a pure application.
* **Part 3** will start to dance the fine line between practical programming and academic absurdity. We'll look at comonads, f-algebras, free monads, yoneda, and other categorical constructs.

### Checking If jQuery Loaded

Before you can do anything with jQuery you first need to make certain it has loaded:

```javascript
if (typeof jQuery == 'undefined') {
  console.log('jQuery hasn\'t loaded');
} else {
  console.log('jQuery has loaded');
}
```

Now you're off...

<sup>[back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)</sup>


### Use `.on()` Binding Instead of `.click()`

Using `.on()` gives you several advantages over using `.click()`, such as the ability to add multiple events...

```javascript
.on('click tap hover')
```

...a binding applies to dynamically created elements, as well (there's no need to manually bind every single element dynamically added to a DOM element)...

...and the possibility to set a namespace:

```javascript
.on('click.menuOpening')
```

Namespaces give you the power to unbind a specific event (e.g., `.off('click.menuOpening')`).

<sup>[back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)</sup>


### Back to Top Button

By using the `animate` and `scrollTop` methods in jQuery you don't need a plugin to create a simple scroll-to-top animation:

```javascript
// Back to top
$('.container').on('click', '.back-to-top', function (e) {
  e.preventDefault();
  $('html, body').animate({scrollTop: 0}, 800);
});
```

```html
<!-- Create an anchor tag -->
<div class=""container"">
  <a href=""#"" class=""back-to-top"">Back to top</a>
</div>
```

Changing the `scrollTop` value changes where you wants the scrollbar to land. All you're really doing is animating the body of the document throughout the course of 800 milliseconds until it scrolls to the top of the document.

**Note:** Watch for some [buggy behavior](https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/issues/417) with `scrollTop`.

<sup>[back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)</sup>


### Preload Images

If your web page uses a lot of images that aren't visible initially (e.g., on hover) it makes sense to preload them:

```javascript
$.preloadImages = function () {
  for (var i = 0; i < arguments.length; i++) {
    $('<img>').attr('src', arguments[i]);
  }
};

$.preloadImages('img/hover-on.png', 'img/hover-off.png');
```

<sup>[back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)</sup>


### Checking If Images Are Loaded

Sometimes you might need to check if your images have fully loaded in order to continue on with your scripts:

```javascript
$('img').on('load', function () {
  console.log('image load successful');
});
```

You can also check if one particular image has loaded by replacing the `<img>` tag with an ID or class.

<sup>[back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)</sup>


### Fix Broken Images Automatically

If you happen to find broken image links on your site replacing them one by one can be a pain. This simple piece of code can save a lot of headaches:

```javascript
$('img').on('error', function () {
  if(!$(this).hasClass('broken-image')) {
    $(this).prop('src', 'img/broken.png').addClass('broken-image');
  }
});
```

Alternatively, if you wish to simply hide broken images this snippet will take care of that for:

```javascript
$('img').on('error', function () {
  $(this).hide();
});
```

<sup>[back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)</sup>


### Post a Form with AJAX

jQuery AJAX methods are a common way to request text, HTML, XML, or JSON. If you wanted to send a form via AJAX you could collect the user inputs via the `val()` method:

```javascript
$.post('sign_up.php', {
  user_name: $('input[name=user_name]').val(),
  email:     $('input[name=email]').val(),
  password:  $('input[name=password]').val(),
});
```

However, all of those `val()` calls are expensive. A better way of collecting the user inputs is using the `serialize()` function which collects the user inputs as a string:

```javascript
$.post('sign_up', $('#sign-up-form').serialize());
```

<sup>[back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)</sup>


### Toggle Classes on Hover

Let's say you want to change the visual of a clickable element on your page when a user hovers over it. You can add a class to your element when the user is hovering; when the user stops hovering removes the class:

```javascript
$('.btn').on('hover', function () {
  $(this).addClass('hover');
}, function () {
  $(this).removeClass('hover');
});
```

You just need to add the necessary CSS. If you want an even _simpler_ way use the `toggleClass` method:

```javascript
$('.btn').on('hover', function () {
  $(this).toggleClass('hover');
});
```

**Note:** CSS may be a faster solution in this case but it's still worthwhile to know this.

<sup>[back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)</sup>


### Disabling Input Fields

At times you may want the submit button of a form or one of its text inputs to be disabled until the user has performed a certain action (e.g., checking the ""I've read the terms"" checkbox). Add the `disabled` attribute to your input so you can enable it when you want:

```javascript
$('input[type=""submit""]').prop('disabled', true);
```

All you need to do is run the `prop` method again on the input, but set the value of `disabled` to `false`:

```javascript
$('input[type=""submit""]').prop('disabled', false);
```

<sup>[back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)</sup>


### Stop the Loading of Links

Sometimes you don't want links to go to a certain web page nor reload the page; you might want them to do something else like trigger some other script. This will do the trick of preventing the default action:

```javascript
$('a.no-link').on('click', function (e) {
  e.preventDefault();
});
```

<sup>[back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)</sup>


### Cache jQuery Selectors

Think of how many times you write the same selector over and over again in any project. Every `$('.element')` selector has to search the entire DOM each time, regardless if that selector had previously run. Instead, run the selector once and store the results in a variable:

```javascript
var blocks = $('#blocks').find('li');
```

Now you can use the `blocks` variable wherever you want without having to search the DOM every time:

```javascript
$('#hideBlocks').on('click', function () {
  blocks.fadeOut();
});

$('#showBlocks').on('click', function () {
  blocks.fadeIn();
});
```

Caching jQuery selectors are an easy performance gain.

<sup>[back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)</sup>


### Toggle Fade/Slide

Sliding and fading are something we use plenty in our animations with jQuery. You might just want to show an element when a user clicks something, which makes the `fadeIn` and `slideDown` methods perfect. But if you want that element to appear on the first click and then disappear on the second this will work just fine:

```javascript
// Fade
$('.btn').on('click', function () {
  $('.element').fadeToggle('slow');
});

// Toggle
$('.btn').on('click', function () {
  $('.element').slideToggle('slow');
});
```

<sup>[back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)</sup>


### Simple Accordion

This is a simple method for a quick accordion:

```javascript
// Close all panels
$('#accordion').find('.content').hide();

// Accordion
$('#accordion').find('.accordion-header').on('click', function () {
  var next = $(this).next();
  next.slideToggle('fast');
  $('.content').not(next).slideUp('fast');
  return false;
});
```

By adding this script all you really needs to do on your web page is the necessary HTML go get this working.

### Make Two Divs the Same Height

Sometimes you'll want two divs to have the same height no matter what content they have in them:

```javascript
$('.div').css('min-height', $('.main-div').height());
```

This example sets the `min-height` which means that it can be bigger than the main div but never smaller. However, a more flexible method would be to loop over a set of elements and set the height to the height of the tallest element:

```javascript
var $columns = $('.column');
var height = 0;
$columns.each(function () {
  if ($(this).height() > height) {
    height = $(this).height();
  }
});
$columns.height(height);
```

If you want _all_ columns to have the same height:

```javascript
var $rows = $('.same-height-columns');
$rows.each(function () {
  $(this).find('.column').height($(this).height());
});
```

**Note:** This can be done several ways [in CSS](http://codepen.io/AllThingsSmitty/pen/KMPqoO) but depending on what your needs are, knowing how to do this in jQuery is still worthwhile.

### Open External Links in New Tab/Window

Open external links in a new browser tab or window and ensure links on the same origin open in the same tab or window:

```javascript
$('a[href^=""http""]').attr('target', '_blank');
$('a[href^=""//""]').attr('target', '_blank');
$('a[href^=""' + window.location.origin + '""]').attr('target', '_self');
```

**Note:** `window.location.origin` doesn't work in IE10. [This fix](http://tosbourn.com/a-fix-for-window-location-origin-in-internet-explorer/) takes care of the issue.

### Find Element By Text

By using the `contains()` selector in jQuery you can find text in content of an element. If text doesn't exists, that element will be hidden:

```javascript
var search = $('#search').val();
$('div:not(:contains(""' + search + '""))').hide();
```

<sup>[back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)</sup>


### Trigger on Visibility Change

Trigger JavaScript when the user is no longer focusing on a tab, or refocuses on a tab:

```javascript
$(document).on('visibilitychange', function (e) {
  if (e.target.visibilityState === 'visible') {
    console.log('Tab is now in view!');
  } else if (e.target.visibilityState === 'hidden') {
    console.log('Tab is now hidden!');
  }
});
```

### Ajax Call Error Handling

When an Ajax call returns a 404 or 500 error the error handler will be executed. If the handler isn't defined, other jQuery code might not work anymore. Define a global Ajax error handler:

```javascript
$(document).on('ajaxError', function (e, xhr, settings, error) {
  console.log(error);
});
```

<sup>[back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)</sup>


### Chain Plugin Calls

jQuery allows for the ""chaining"" of plugin method calls to mitigate the process of repeatedly querying the DOM and creating multiple jQuery objects. Let's say the following snippet represents your plugin method calls:

```javascript
$('#elem').show();
$('#elem').html('bla');
$('#elem').otherStuff();
```

This could be vastly improved by using chaining:

```javascript
$('#elem')
  .show()
  .html('bla')
  .otherStuff();
```

An alternative is to cache the element in a variable (prefixed with `$`):

```javascript
var $elem = $('#elem');
$elem.hide();
$elem.html('bla');
$elem.otherStuff();
```

Both chaining and [caching](#cache-jquery-selectors) methods in jQuery are best practices that lead to shorter and faster code.

### Sort List Items Alphabetically

Let's say you end up with too many items in a list. Maybe the content is produced by a CMS and you want to order them alphabetically:

```javascript
var ul = $('#list'),
lis = $('li', ul).get();

lis.sort(function (a, b) {
  return ($(a).text().toUpperCase() < $(b).text().toUpperCase()) ? -1 : 1;
});

ul.append(lis);
```

There you go!

This is the companion code for the Code Schools Ember course. This showcases the code used in the slides.

## Complete Example

The finished application can be found at `demo/index.html`. Open that up in your browser and you're good to go!

If you want to see what the application looked like at a specific state during the course, you can go the more elaborate route and set up the Rails application which allows for serving the ember app at each point we show it during the slides.

## Setup

This is a Ruby on Rails application, so in order to run it you'll need to have Ruby 1.9.3. Here's the setup you'll need to do to in order to see the examples.

First off, you'll need to have Ruby installed. We recommend using either [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv) or [RVM](https://rvm.io/), but your system Ruby will suffice as well. Code School has a [Code TV](https://www.codeschool.com/code_tv/rvm) on using RVM as well.

With Ruby installed, make sure to install the bundler gem.

```
$ gem install bundler
```

Next, download or clone this repository, change directory into it, and `bundle`.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/codeschool/EmberCourseDemo.git
$ cd EmberCourseDemo
EmberCourseDemo $ bundle install
```

Next, setup the database -- which contains information on the code samples used in the course.

```
EmberCourseDemo $ bundle exec rake db:setup
```

## Running

After that, you should be all set to run the application:

```
EmberCourseDemo $ bundle exec rails s
```

This will start the application on port 3000. Open up [http://localhost:3000/examples](http://localhost:3000/examples) in a browser and head to any code sample.

============

Slides for an introductory course on LaTeX. The slides and their LaTeX source
code are provided in [this github repository](https://github.com/jdleesmiller/latex-course) under a permissive MIT license.

The aim is to get students writing in LaTeX as quickly as possible. The material is presented as a set of examples, and broader concepts and techniques are explained as they arise. Each part includes exercises that can be completed on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com), the free online LaTeX editor, so you don't have to worry about getting LaTeX and related tools installed on everyone's computers.

These slides were originally used to deliver two two-hour workshops, but there is probably enough material for three workshops, so there are three parts:

1. [The Basics](http://jdleesmiller.github.io/latex-course/en/part1.pdf): ideas, syntax, equations, environments, packages

1. [Structed Documents &
More](http://jdleesmiller.github.io/latex-course/en/part2.pdf): titles, sections, cross-references, figures, tables, bibliographies.

1. [Not Just Papers: Presentations & More](http://jdleesmiller.github.io/latex-course/en/part3.pdf): recap exercise, presentations with beamer, drawings with
tikz.

Feel free to use however you like --- contributions welcome!

Development
-----------

You may need to install some extra LaTeX packages and system packages in order
to build the slides yourself.

1. The [minted package](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/minted) provides syntax
highlighting. It is installed by default in recent versions of TeX Live.

1. The minted package calls out to the
[pygments syntax highlighter](http://pygments.org/), which is written in python.
The relevant package is python-pygments in Debian / Ubuntu
(`sudo apt-get install python-pygments`).

1. There is a simple `Makefile` that manages the build. To use it, you'll
probably need to be on Linux, and you will need `make`.

The slides include links to exercises that open in Overleaf. The exercise
source files are hosted on github. If you want to use exercise files in another
location, you can [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) this
github repository and then change the `\fileuri` macro in `preamble.tex`:
```
\newcommand{\fileuri}{https://raw.github.com/jdleesmiller/latex-course/master/en}
```
so that instead of pointing to `jdleesmiller/latex-course`, it points to
`your-github-user-name/latex-course`. Then, once you've pushed your changed
exercise files to github, the slides will load them up in Overleaf.

The `deploy-to-gh-pages.sh` script builds the slides using the Makefile and
copies the slides over to the `gh-pages` branch, which is available at
`https://jdlm.info/latex-course` thanks to
[github pages](http://pages.github.com/).

# Data visualization with Python course

© 2016 Randal S. Olson

In this repository, you will find course materials for teaching data visualization with Python. I'll be developing these teaching materials over time to provide a hands-on course that will take you from beginner to intermediate level of programming data visualizations.

Some of these materials are based on the video course I developed with O'Reilly called [Data Visualization Basics with Python](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920046592.do).

## Course Prerequisites

I designed this course with the expectation that you will have a basic working knowledge of Python, [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/), and the [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/). If you're unfamiliar with any of these topics, I have provided links to free online learning materials for them below.

**Python** has many excellent tutorials and books to learn from, many of which are listed in the [/r/LearnPython wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/index).

**pandas** has [several tutorials](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/tutorials.html) covering its myriad features.

This is homework to understand git/github

**NOTE:** This homework is located on another repository.
https://github.com/agent-system/homework20150415/

# 2015/4/22

This homework is for understanding a concept of Robot Architecture, and ROS(Robot Operating System).

Before doing this homework, you have to setup catkin ROS workspace for executing homework.

```bash
# install catkin tools
$ sudo apt-get install python-catkin-tools python-rosdep ros-hydro-desktop-full
# create directory for workspace
$ mkdir -p $HOME/ros/hydro/src
$ cd $HOME/ros/hydro
# initialize workspace
$ source /opt/ros/hydro/setup.bash
$ catkin init
$ cd src
# put homework on your workspace
$ git clone https://github.com/agent-system/homework
$ cd ..
# install dependencies
$ sudo rosdep init
$ rosdep update
$ rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r
$ source /opt/ros/hydro/setup.bash
# build homework20150422 package
$ catkin build homework20150422
$ source $HOME/ros/hydro/devel/setup.bash
$ echo 'source $HOME/ros/hydro/devel/setup.bash' >> $HOME/.bashrc
```

# 2015/4/29-

# 2015/6/17

See the gazebo slides in the slide archives: http://1drv.ms/1FdAUDy 

Getting Started with Gazebo

```bash
# launch gazebo with samplerobot

wget -q -O /tmp/jsk.rosbuild https://raw.github.com/jsk-ros-pkg/jsk_common/master/jsk.rosbuild
bash /tmp/jsk.rosbuild -s --rtm hydro

# terminal 1
roslaunch hrpsys_gazebo_tutorials gazebo_samplerobot_no_controllers.launch
# terminal 2
rtmlaunch hrpsys_gazebo_tutorials samplerobot_hrpsys_bringup.launch
# terminal 3
roscd hrpsys_ros_bridge_tutorials/euslisp
roseus samplerobot-interface.l
(samplerobot-init)
(send *ri* :angle-vector (send *sr* :reset-pose) 4000)
(send *ri* :start-auto-balancer)
(send *ri* :start-st)
(send *ri* :go-pos -0.5 0 0) ;; x y theta [m]


# with kinect

roscd hrpsys_gazebo_tutorials
git remote add furushchev https://github.com/furushchev/rtmros_tutorials.git
git fetch furushchev
git checkout -b samplerobot-with-kinect furushchev/samplerobot-with-kinect
catkin bt

source ~/ros/hydro/devel/setup.bash
# terminal 1
roslaunch hrpsys_gazebo_tutorials gazebo_samplerobot_no_controllers_drc_testbed.launch

# terminal 2
rtmlaunch hrpsys_gazebo_tutorials samplerobot_hrpsys_bringup.launch

# terminal 3
rosrun rviz rviz
# add RobotModel, PointCloud2 and Camera on rviz menu
# choose /xtion/depth/points/ at Topic of PointCloud2
# choose /xtion/depth/merge_raw at Image Topic of Camera

# terminal 4
roscd hrpsys_ros_bridge_tutorials/euslisp
roseus samplerobot-interface.l
# you may need rosrun roseus generate-all-msg-srv.sh 

;; 以下roseus
(samplerobot-init)
(send *ri* :angle-vector (send *sr* :reset-pose) 4000)
(send *ri* :start-auto-balancer)
(send *ri* :start-st)
(send *ri* :go-pos -0.5 0 0) ;; x y theta [m]

```

## Tips

- when executing `catkin bt`, error `collada_urdf_jsk_patch not found` occurs in indigo

    please add `jsk_3rdparty` repository to your local and build again

    ```bash
roscd
cd ../src
wstool set jsk-ros-pkg/jsk_3rdparty --git https://github.com/jsk-ros-pkg/jsk_3rdparty.git
wstool up jsk-ros-pkg/jsk_3rdparty
cd jsk-ros-pkg/jsk_3rdparty/3rdparty/assimp_devel
touch CATKIN_IGNORE # this is for speedup compiling
cd ..
catkin build collada_urdf_jsk_patch
catkin build hrpsys_gazebo_tutorials
source devel/setup.bash
```

This repo stores the homework assignments for CIS 198.

We are using Classroom for GitHub. That means each student can create a private
GitHub repository to do their work in. Except for hw0 (which has almost no
submitable content), these links are public for anyone to use! If you're a Penn
student enrolled in the class, this is also how you submit assignments: just
push to your repository by the due date.

Pull requests or issues are welcome and highly appreciated!

Create a tiny RESTful web service with the following business requirements:

- Application must expose REST API endpoints for the following functionality:
  - apply for loan (`loan amount`, `term`, `name`, `surname` and `personal id` must be provided)
  - list all approved loans
  - list all approved loans by user
- Service must perform loan application validation according to the following rules and reject application if:
  - Application comes from blacklisted personal id
  - N application / second are received from a single country (essentially we want to limit number of loan applications coming from a country in a given timeframe)
- Service must perform origin country resolution using the following web service and store country code together with the loan application. Because network is unreliable and services tend to fail, let's agree on default country code - ""lv"".

### Technical requirements

You have total control over framework and tools, as long as application is written in Java. Feel free to write tests in any JVM language.

### What gets evaluated

- Conformance to business requirements
- Code quality, including testability
- How easy it is to run and deploy the service (don't make us install Oracle database please ;)

**Good luck and have fun!**

## About this course

This course is for programmers looking to build web-based applications
(includes programmers who are new to web development).
It is vital to note that course is not a complete introduction to Ruby language.
The goal is to provide students skills for individual building web applications.
The peculiarity of this course is that the Ruby language and Ruby on Rails
framework studied synchronously.

Check out [repo](https://github.com/micrum/course-app) and
[live version](https://course-app.herokuapp.com/) of demo application built on course.

## What the Course Covers

### 1. Interactive Data Vis: Design Principles, Techniques, Best-Practices...

Originally intended as having a journalistic focus, the course contents will expand a little more in spring 2016 to address broader topics in visualization. (Those additions are in progress.)

* [Week1](Week1): Intro to Tools and the Course, Setup, CSVs
* [Week2](Week2): Loading CSV Data, Highcharts
* [Week3](Week3): Data Loading, Tables in D3
* [Week4](Week4): More tables, Scales, SVG
* [Week5](Week5): Bar Charts, Axes, Text Labels, Scatterplots
* [Week6](Week6): Linecharts, Events, Simple Tooltips
* [Week7](Week7): Improved Line Charts, Transitions
* [Week8](Week8): Updates to Data, More Transitions
* [Week9](Week9): Stacking Chart Types, Intro to Small Multiples
* [Week10](Week10): Small Multiples, Intro to Maps
* [Week11](Week11): Maps: D3, Leaflet, CartoDB...
* [Week12](Week12): Storytelling Techniques: Scrollytelling, Steppers
* [Week13](Week13): Animation: Lines, Play/Pause...
* [Week14](Week14):  Reusable charts, Other Layouts, Project Tips/Grading
* [Week15](Week15): Helpful Tips: How to File a Bug Report, Debugging

All the made-for-class example files are [here](examples.html). Many other examples are linked in each week's folder.

### 2. Programming Techniques and Tools We'll Cover

* Good practices with D3.js for data vis
* Javascript and useful libraries like jQuery, lodash
* Web Charting libs like Highcharts, D3, libs on top of D3 like Dimple.js
* GitHub use
* Debugging how-to's

### 3. Evaluation

Grading based on weekly homeworks (60%) and a final project (40%) that uses many of the techniques in a storytelling project using data that interests you.  This is a project course - you will be making things more than you will be reading or writing, but there will be a bit of that, too.

Primary emphasis is on end user experience and data honesty; secondary consideration will be good coding practices.

**Homework Due Dates**: Due by 5pm on Monday before class day, unless I decide otherwise... You will be submitting links by email (arnicas@gmail.com).

## Data Sources To Use

### UNICEF & Child Mortality (Fall Semester Client, optional for Spring)

* [The client brief](miscfiles/APromiseRenewed_Brief_March2015.pdf)
* The 2014 Key Findings Report on http://www.apromiserenewed.org/: [pdf](http://www.apromiserenewed.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/A-Promise-Renewed-2014-Key-Findings.pdf) (plus other publications that may be useful!)
* Their data sites: http://data.unicef.org/index.php, http://mics.unicef.org
* World Health Org (WHO): http://www.who.int/research/en/
* http://childmortality.org/ - UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (IGME), of which UNICEF is a member (new data coming in September)

### Links to Datasets

* Jeremy Singer-Vine's excellent tinyletter archives for Data Is Plural (and maybe get on the list!): http://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/archive, his [giant spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wZhPLMCHKJvwOkP4juclhjFgqIY8fQFMemwKL2c64vk/edit#gid=0)

## Background: D3 Books and Tutorial Materials

* **Interactive Data Visualization for the Web** (""IDVW""), Scott Murray’s book: http://alignedleft.com/work/d3-book
Online version: http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000345.  [Code samples here](https://github.com/alignedleft/d3-book). *This is the book I'll assign most intro D3 readings from.*
* **D3 Tips and Tricks** book by Malcolm MacLean, and http://www.d3noob.org/
* **D3.js in Action** (""D3IA""), by Elijah Meeks.  If you want ebook, order via Manning: http://www.manning.com/.  This is a more advanced book than Scott's, and covers many D3 layouts we won't get to in class.  Recommended for going further.
* **Developing a D3 Edge** by By Chris Viau, Andrew Thornton, Ger Hobbelt, and Roland Dunn: http://bleedingedgepress.com/our-books/developing-a-d3-js-edge/ (intermediate (i.e., more advanced than the ones above; covers good coding patterns too.)
* Tutorials by **Mike Bostock**, primary author of D3: https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Tutorials (and some others listed).
* **Learn JS Data** from Bocoup.com: http://learnjsdata.com/index.html
* **Blocksplorer**: search for code examples in D3 blocks! http://bl.ocksplorer.org/
* Great overall tips: https://northlandia.wordpress.com/2014/10/23/ten-best-practices-for-coding-with-d3/
* **D3 examples of Chart Types**: http://christopheviau.com/d3list/gallery.html
* **D3 Newbie FAQ**: I am working on this, and will be editing it as we encounter new ones :). https://github.com/arnicas/d3-faq
* Videos on D3:
    * Knight Center D3 Course video playlists: I'll recommend some of Scott Murray's videos as backup or weekend viewing. (They don't seem to be well-indexed on YouTube, but start [here](https://www.youtube.com/user/KnightCenterMOOC/playlists).  The code examples are [here](https://github.com/alignedleft/data-vis-d3).
    * These intro videos seem good too: https://www.youtube.com/user/d3Vienno/videos


## JS Refreshers

* These books on HTML/CSS and JS/JQuery are good: http://www.amazon.com/Web-Design-HTML-JavaScript-jQuery/dp/1118907442/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1440438330&sr=8-1&keywords=jon+duckett
* A short recap: http://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/javascript/
* A super simple intro with gif demos is JS For Cats: http://jsforcats.com/
* Useful for your code style: **[Airbnb JS Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/es5)**
* More online courses: https://www.javascript.com/resources.

=============
This course is out of date. 

## Express Changes
The latest version of express has deprecated the body parser middleware.

That means that when you see the following line of code:
```
app.use(bodyParser());
```
you should instead use the following two lines of code:
```
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({extended: true}));
app.use(bodyParser.json());
```

The latest version of express has also changed the session middleware a little bit and now requires that you explicitly specify a value for the resave parameter and the saveUninitialized parameter. So in the module on authentication when you see the following code:
```
app.use(session({secret: 'multi vision unicorns'}))
```
you should instead use the following code:
```
app.use(session({secret: 'multi vision unicorns',resave:false,saveUninitialized:false}));
```

## Angular Changes
In addition to that, Angular 1.3 now requires a base tag when using html5Mode routing. In your layout.jade file (and maybe earlier in your index.jade), in the head you should place the following line of code:
```
base(href=""/"")
```

## MongoDB Changes
Current versions of MongoDB require a ""query"" when calling the remove function. So periodically in the course we will delete all the users from the db with the following command:
```
db.users.remove()
```
But instead, you need to pass an empty ""query object"" into the remove function like this:
```
db.users.remove({})
```

Notes:
To run the node server, type ""node web-server.js"" or ""nodemon web-server.js"" from the directory that contains the web-server.js file

## Crypto Changes
In more recent versions of node.js update() and digest() are legacy methods. The new approach is to use the streaming API methods write() end() and read();

```
function hashPwd(salt, pwd){
  var hmac = crypto.createHmac('sha1', salt);
  hmac.setEncoding('hex');
  hmac.write(pwd);
  hmac.end();
  return hmac.read();
}
```

## Description

Create classes to track employees and their departments, interpret employee reviews, and give out raises to those with good reviews.


## Objectives

### Learning Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should...

* Understand how a pair of classes can work together
* Understand keyword arguments
* Understand how regular expressions can be used in real-world problems
* Understand simple classification problems
* Reflect on how natural language can be read by a computer to convert it to quantitative data

### Performance Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should be able to effectively use...

* Test-driven development
* Simple regular expressions
* Keyword arguments

## Details

### Deliverables

* **A Pull Request.** Fork this repository, make your changes, and then create a pull request.
* **An Employee and a Department Class.**
* **A Test Suite.** Not only must this test suite be conceptually complete, it must be written before the code that satisfies it.  This can be determined by git commits (so commit often!!!)

### Requirements

You want to keep track of employees (with their names and salaries), departments (with their names), and which employees are in which department.  You should be able to:

* Create a new department (given its name).
* Create a new employee (given his/her name and salary).
* Add an employee to a department.
* Get an employee's name.
* Get an employee's salary.
* Get a department's name.
* Get a total salary for all employees in a department.
* Add some employee review text (a paragraph or two) to an employee.
* Mark whether an employee is performing satisfactorily or not satisfactorily.
* Give a raise to an individual.  You decide if this makes sense in dollars or in percent.
* Give raises to a department's employees.  You must pass this method a total dollar amount, and it must distribute the raise amounts reasonably to the department's employees.  Only employees who are performing satisfactorily should get raises.

## Normal Mode

To complete normal mode, you must first meet all of the requirements above.  Your test suite should have at least one complete example (also known as a ""pathological"" example) of how the two classes can be used in the real world.

In order to finish normal mode, you must also TRY hard mode.  You do not have to complete it, but you to have to try.

## Hard Mode

As a part of this repository, you have a file called `sample_reviews.txt`.  This file includes two negative employee reviews and two positive employee reviews.  Your task is to write a method on the employee class which looks the employee review text stored in an employee instance variable (added as a part of Normal Mode) and return a true or false for whether this employee is performing satisfactorily.

Regular expressions will be your friend here, but even so, this is not an easy problem.  It is in a category of problems called ""Natural Language Processing,"" and since you are attempting to take reviews and place them in one of two buckets (satisfactory or not), it is known as a ""Classification"" problem.

## Nightmare Mode

As mentioned above, placing reviews into two buckets is a ""Classification"" problem.  Your task in Nightmare Mode is to solve a ""Regression"" problem instead.  Assign each employee a SCORE based on his/her review rather than a yes/no value.  After creating this method, modify your departmental raise function to take this score value into account when giving out raises.

*An example homework assignment in Python for demonstrating how homework is done
in the course.*

In this (example) assignment we will learn some basic Python. In particular, we
will learn about basic Python arithmetic, list handling, and how to create
Python modules as well as an introduction to writing tests using Python's
`unittest` module.

## Objective

Provide definitions to the functions `square` and `cube` defined in the Python
submodules `example_homework.squaring` and `example_homework.cubing`,
respectively.

```python
def square(x):
    # return the square of x
    
def cube(x):
    # return the cube of x
```

The provided example test suite can be executed using

```
$ python ./test_example_homework.py
```

As always, you are welcome (and encouraged) to add your own tests to the test
suite to ensure that your code is robust. Most of all, make sure that the
supplied tests pass so that the grading software can import and use your
function as expected.

## Grading

When the homework deadline is reached your implementation of `square` and `cube`
will be run against the following tests:

* (1/5) the square and cube of zero is zero (already in the provided test suite)
* (1/5) the square and cube of two is four and eight, respectively (already in
  the provided test suite)
* (1/5) `square` and `cube` should behave appropriately with complex numbers as
  input (e.g. `1.0 - 2.0j`)
* (2/5) these functions should also be able to act on Python `list`s of numbers
  without the use of the Python function `map`. that is, if the input is of type
  `list` then the output should also be of type `list` containing appropriate
  corresponding values

It is important that the function names and locations DO NOT CHANGE. Otherwise,
the test suite used for grading may not be able to import your code. If it's
importable in the test suite provided to you it should be importable in the
grading test suite.

==============

I took [Charlie Barnes' Logic, Reasoning, and
Proofs](https://sites.google.com/site/barneslogicf13/home). I completed the
course the Fall semester of 2012, and it was great! It is based on his textbook
which can be found
[here](https://sites.google.com/site/barneslogicf13/materials) along with other
course material.

Machine Learning
================

I am working on the homework from Andrew Ng's [machine learning course on
Coursera](https://class.coursera.org/ml-005). I am using IPython Notebooks in
combination with the NumPy rather than Octave, which the instructor uses. I
invite the reader to compare both programming languages and decide for
himself/herself which one is more agreeable.

Digital Signal Processing
=========================

I am reworking some homework from [Digital Signal Processing]
(https://class.coursera.org/dsp-004) on Coursera. They use IPython Notebooks,
as well as I.

#SF-WDI-26 Homework submission

Homework will be turned in to your fork of this repository daily.

##Setup

To set up your initial homework repository do the following:

* fork this repo to create a copy of it on your github account
* clone the forked repo from your github account onto your computer inside your `dev/` directory
* `cd` into the newly cloned repo on your computer
* `mkdir **GIT-USER-NAME**`
* `cd **GIT-USER-NAME**`
* `echo ""#**YOUR NAME**'s Homework repo"" > README.md` to set up your repo's README
* `git add -A` to stage your changes
* `git commit -m ""inital commit""` to have git save your changes
* `git push origin master` to put your changes up on github!

**GIT-USER-NAME** should be replaced with your actual git user name (must be exact)

**YOUR NAME** should be your actual name.



##Submit homework

Each day you will submit your homework by doing the following from within your homework repo on your computer:

* copy any required files into your homework repo directory as instructed in homework writeup
* `git add -A` to stage all your changes
* `git commit -m ""homework commit""` to have git save the changes -- feel free to add to the commit message if you'd like
* `git push origin master` to put the changes up on github
* go to your homework repo's page on your account on github.com
* create a pull request according to the guidelines below

####Pull request details

(Must be in this format)

**Title:** `w##d##`

Replace ## with week and day number (eg w01d02  = homework for week 1 day 2)

**Message:**

```
comfort: #
completeness: #

Message about your experience goes here
```

Replace the `#`s next to comfort and completness with a number (1 - 5) to represent how comfortable you are with the topic and how much of the assignment you were able to complete.  A 1 is the lowest (least comfortable / very little complete), and a 5 is the highest (most comfortable / fully complete).

Homework will be turned in to your fork of this repository daily.

##Setup

To set up your initial homework repository do the following:

* fork this repo to create a copy of it on your github account
* clone the forked repo from your github account onto your computer inside your `dev/` directory
* `cd` into the newly cloned repo on your computer
* `mkdir **GIT-USER-NAME**`
* `cd **GIT-USER-NAME**`
* `echo ""#**YOUR NAME**'s Homework repo"" > README.md` to set up your repo's README
* `git add -A` to stage your changes

## Description

Create classes to track employees and their departments, interpret employee reviews, and give out raises to those with good reviews.


## Objectives

### Learning Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should...

* Understand how a pair of classes can work together
* Understand keyword arguments
* Understand how regular expressions can be used in real-world problems
* Understand simple classification problems
* Reflect on how natural language can be read by a computer to convert it to quantitative data

### Performance Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should be able to effectively use...

* Test-driven development
* Simple regular expressions
* Keyword arguments

## Details

### Deliverables

* **A Pull Request.** Fork this repository, make your changes, and then create a pull request.
* **An Employee and a Department Class.**
* **A Test Suite.** Not only must this test suite be conceptually complete, it must be written before the code that satisfies it.  This can be determined by git commits (so commit often!!!)

### Requirements

You want to keep track of employees (with their names and salaries), departments (with their names), and which employees are in which department.  You should be able to:

* Create a new department (given its name).
* Create a new employee (given his/her name and salary).
* Add an employee to a department.
* Get an employee's name.
* Get an employee's salary.
* Get a department's name.
* Get a total salary for all employees in a department.
* Add some employee review text (a paragraph or two) to an employee.
* Mark whether an employee is performing satisfactorily or not satisfactorily.
* Give a raise to an individual.  You decide if this makes sense in dollars or in percent.
* Give raises to a department's employees.  You must pass this method a total dollar amount, and it must distribute the raise amounts reasonably to the department's employees.  Only employees who are performing satisfactorily should get raises.

To complete normal mode, you must first meet all of the requirements above.  Your test suite should have at least one complete example (also known as a ""pathological"" example) of how the two classes can be used in the real world.

In order to finish normal mode, you must also TRY hard mode.  You do not have to complete it, but you to have to try.

## Hard Mode

As a part of this repository, you have a file called `sample_reviews.txt`.  This file includes two negative employee reviews and two positive employee reviews.  Your task is to write a method on the employee class which looks the employee review text stored in an employee instance variable (added as a part of Normal Mode) and return a true or false for whether this employee is performing satisfactorily.

Regular expressions will be your friend here, but even so, this is not an easy problem.  It is in a category of problems called ""Natural Language Processing,"" and since you are attempting to take reviews and place them in one of two buckets (satisfactory or not), it is known as a ""Classification"" problem.

## Nightmare Mode

As mentioned above, placing reviews into two buckets is a ""Classification"" problem.  Your task in Nightmare Mode is to solve a ""Regression"" problem instead.  Assign each employee a SCORE based on his/her review rather than a yes/no value.  After creating this method, modify your departmental raise function to take this score value into account when giving out raises.

This second programming assignment will require you to write an R
function that is able to cache potentially time-consuming computations.
For example, taking the mean of a numeric vector is typically a fast
operation. However, for a very long vector, it may take too long to
compute the mean, especially if it has to be computed repeatedly (e.g.
in a loop). If the contents of a vector are not changing, it may make
sense to cache the value of the mean so that when we need it again, it
can be looked up in the cache rather than recomputed. In this
Programming Assignment you will take advantage of the scoping rules of
the R language and how they can be manipulated to preserve state inside
of an R object.

### Example: Caching the Mean of a Vector

In this example we introduce the `<<-` operator which can be used to
assign a value to an object in an environment that is different from the
current environment. Below are two functions that are used to create a
special object that stores a numeric vector and caches its mean.

The first function, `makeVector` creates a special ""vector"", which is
really a list containing a function to

1.  set the value of the vector
2.  get the value of the vector
3.  set the value of the mean
4.  get the value of the mean

<!-- -->

    makeVector <- function(x = numeric()) {
            m <- NULL
            set <- function(y) {
                    x <<- y
                    m <<- NULL
            }
            get <- function() x
            setmean <- function(mean) m <<- mean
            getmean <- function() m
            list(set = set, get = get,
                 setmean = setmean,
                 getmean = getmean)
    }

The following function calculates the mean of the special ""vector""
created with the above function. However, it first checks to see if the
mean has already been calculated. If so, it `get`s the mean from the
cache and skips the computation. Otherwise, it calculates the mean of
the data and sets the value of the mean in the cache via the `setmean`
function.

    cachemean <- function(x, ...) {
            m <- x$getmean()
            if(!is.null(m)) {
                    message(""getting cached data"")
                    return(m)
            }
            data <- x$get()
            m <- mean(data, ...)
            x$setmean(m)
            m
    }

### Assignment: Caching the Inverse of a Matrix

Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some
benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than computing it
repeatedly (there are also alternatives to matrix inversion that we will
not discuss here). Your assignment is to write a pair of functions that
cache the inverse of a matrix.

Write the following functions:

1.  `makeCacheMatrix`: This function creates a special ""matrix"" object
    that can cache its inverse.
2.  `cacheSolve`: This function computes the inverse of the special
    ""matrix"" returned by `makeCacheMatrix` above. If the inverse has
    already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then
    `cacheSolve` should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

Computing the inverse of a square matrix can be done with the `solve`
function in R. For example, if `X` is a square invertible matrix, then
`solve(X)` returns its inverse.

For this assignment, assume that the matrix supplied is always
invertible.

In order to complete this assignment, you must do the following:

1.  Fork the GitHub repository containing the stub R files at
    [https://github.com/rdpeng/ProgrammingAssignment2](https://github.com/rdpeng/ProgrammingAssignment2)
    to create a copy under your own account.
2.  Clone your forked GitHub repository to your computer so that you can
    edit the files locally on your own machine.
3.  Edit the R file contained in the git repository and place your
    solution in that file (please do not rename the file).
4.  Commit your completed R file into YOUR git repository and push your
    git branch to the GitHub repository under your account.
5.  Submit to Coursera the URL to your GitHub repository that contains
    the completed R code for the assignment.

## 1. Queue (Time Limit: 3s)
### Description
In computer science, a queue is a particular kind of abstract data type or collection in which the entities in the collection are kept in order and the principal (or only) operations on the collection are the addition of entities to the rear terminal position, known as enqueue, and removal of entities from the front terminal position, known as dequeue.

We all should have learned how queues work before. But today we are considering a queue in the real world instead of a queue in computer science. There are n people queueing up for the tickets of the ADA course, numbered from 1 to n respectively. Since the ADA course is very popular, some of them may even fight for a better place in the queue.

The fights in the ADA course is very special. When person i is fighting against person j, person i wins if and only if c(i−j)(i+j)emodp>p2, where c,e,p are numbers predefined by TAs. We say a queue is stable if the first person in the queue can beat the second person in the queue, the second person can beat the third, and so on. Please help us arrange a stable queue.

### Input Format
The first line contains an integer T indicating the total number of test cases. Each test case contains four integers n,c,e,p in one line.

* 1≤T≤10
* 2≤n≤200000
* 1≤c<p
* 0≤e≤1018
* 2n<p≤2×109
* p is a prime.
* There is at least one stable arrangement.

### Output Format
For each test case, please output n integers which form a stable queue from first to last in one line.

### Sample Input
3
2 1 0 5
3 5 8 13
8 5 3 37

### Sample Output
1 2
1 2 3
7 3 8 6 2 5 4 1

### Hint
* In the first sample, person 1 beats person 2 since 1(1−2)(1+2)0=−1, and −1mod5=4>52.
* There are two bonus tests (3 points each) in this problem. The condition n≤100000 holds for the first 10 tests.

## 2. Lucky Number (Time Limit: 1s)
### Description
We all know that digit 7 is lucky and digit 4 is unlucky. For example, you can win a jackpot if you get 777 on a casino slot machine, and elevators often be missing the 4th floor or any floor whose number contains the digit 4. Even a special term Tetraphobia is created to describe the fear of the digit 4.

In this problem, we say an integer n is a lucky number if:

* The integer n is divisible by 7.
* The decimal representation of n contains at least three digits 7.
* The decimal representation of n contains more digits 7 than digits 4.
For example, 777 and 774746 are lucky numbers; but 7771, 77, and 747474 are not. Can you tell us how many lucky numbers are in range [l,r]?

### Input Format
The first line contains an integer T indicating the total number of test cases. Each test case contains two integers l,r in one line.

* 1≤T≤100000
* 1≤l≤r≤10^18

### Output Format
For each test case, please output an integer indicating how many lucky numbers are in range [l,r] in one line.

### Sample Input
3
1 10000
1 1000
1000 10000

### Sample Output
5
1
4

### Hint
* All lucky numbers in [1,10000] are 777, 7077, 7707, 7770, 7777.
* There are two bonus tests (3 points each) in this problem. The condition T≤300 holds for the first 10 tests.

## 3. Rabbit House (Time Limit: 1s)

### Description

Kokoa is a coffee shop clerk of Rabbit House. Since Rabbit House is a famous coffee shop, it earns lots of money per day. Kokoa records the total income si everyday, and checks whether it matches the cash Rabbit House has now. To prevent malicious modification, she also records ci, which is the checksum of si.

As a normal high school girl, she doesn't know the complicate message digest algorithms like MD5 or SHA-1. Instead, she just calculate the digit sums of si. The digit sum of a given integer is the sum of all its digits. For example, if s=[302,1000,2011], the checksums will be c=[5,1,4].

But this algorithm is too naive. It's easy to construct a different s with same checksums. For instance, if s=[5,10,13], the checksums will also be c=[5,1,4]. To show how unreliable is digit sum, please construct a valid s for a given c, such that the last element of s is as small as possible. If there are more than one possible s, choose the one with smallest sn−1, where n is the length of s. If there are still more than one possible s, choose the one with smallest sn−2, and so on.

### Input Format

The first line contains an integer T indicating the total number of test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n in one line, indicating the number of days, followed by a line of n integers c1,c2,…,cn.

* 1≤T≤10
* 1≤n,ci≤1000

### Output Format

For each test case, please output n integers s1,s2,…,sn in one line. Note that s should be strictly increasing since Rabbit House is famous and has income everyday.

### Sample Input

## 5. Plagiarism (Time Limit: 2s)

### Description

HanHan is the chief urban designer of HyperHacker city. This city is known for its beautiful urban design. To simplify this problem, we treat HyperHacker city as an undirected graph, G1G1.

HugeHammer, the lazy and evil urban designer of HappyHippo City, is too lazy to create his own design. He decides to just copy HanHan’s design, and randomly rename the vertices in the graph. We call the renamed graph G2G2.

To simplify this problem again, we assume that the vertices of G1G1 and G2G2 are labelled as 1,2,…n1,2,…n. The renaming can be viewed as a random permutation ππ of 1,2,…,n1,2,…,n, so an edge (u,v)(u,v) in G1G1 would be an edge (π(u),π(v))(π(u),π(v)) in G2G2.

For example, if there are three vertices and two edges in G1G1 and G2G2. The edges in G1G1 are (1,2)(1,2) and (2,3)(2,3). The edges in G2G2 are (2,3)(2,3) and (1,3)(1,3). A possible permutation is π=⟨1,3,2⟩π=⟨1,3,2⟩. Since we can map edge (1,2)(1,2) in G1G1 to (π(1),π(2))=(1,3)(π(1),π(2))=(1,3) in G2G2, and (2,3)(2,3) in G1G1 to (π(2),π(3))=(3,2)(π(2),π(3))=(3,2) in G2G2. Note that the graphs are undirected, so (2,3)(2,3) and (3,2)(3,2) are interchangeable.

Please help HanHan to find the permutation ππ as the evidence of plagiarism.


### Input Format

The first line contains an integer TT indicating the total number of test cases. Each test case starts with a line containing two integers n,mn,m, denoting the number of nodes and edges in the undirected graphs G1,G2G1,G2. Each the following mm lines contains two integers ai,biai,bi, denoting an edge (ai,bi)(ai,bi) in G1G1. Each the following mm lines contains two integers ci,dici,di, denoting an edge (ci,di)(ci,di) in G2G2.

* 1≤ai,bi,ci,di≤n1≤ai,bi,ci,di≤n
* There be self-loops and/or multi-edges in the graphs.

### Output Format

For each test case, please output the permutation ππ in one line as π(1),π(2),…π(n)π(1),π(2),…π(n) separated by a space. If there are more than one possible permutation, you can output any one of them.

==============

The fifth project for iOS pre-course solving number problems

### Resources:
- You already should have read [Types and Variables](https://devmounta.in/files/iOS/ios-precourse__02TypesVariables.pdf). We're going to do some math with floats and integers. Look back to that document if you don't know the difference.
- For Objective-C you should read [Chapter 7](http://www.bignerdranch.com/documents/objective-c-prereading-assignment.pdf) of Big Nerd Ranch's intro to Objective-C. *Most of it is actually in C, but the syntax is actually the same for what we're doing in this project.*
- For Swift you should read Apple's [documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/BasicOperators.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH6-XID_109) on Basic Operators. 

### Step 1: Get the project started on your computer and on GitHub
- Either create a project locally and push to GitHub
- Or fork this project and clone it to your computer

*Note:*
- *For more detailed instructions of 'Step 1' see the first [project](https://github.com/DevMountain/AGoodStart.git)*
- *'Step 1' is something we will do hundreds of times in class. You need to be able to do it quickly and without running into issues so it doesn't slow class down.*

### Step 2: Create an iteration method
- Add a method called iterateCount that takes an integer 
- The method should call itself and decrement the integer until the value is 0
  - Print the integer with the text ""Iterate [integer]"" where the integer gets printed
  - It should decrement the integer using operator shorthand. 
- In the didFinishLaunching method, call iterateCount and pass in 4

### Step 3: Create a calculation method (multiply)
- Add a method called multiplied that takes an integer and returns an integer
- At the top of the class declare a global static integer called multiple and set it equal to 8
- In the multiplied method, return the integer multiplied by the global variable multiple
  - You can write it out fully, or you can use the operator shorthand
- In the iterateCount method call multiplied and store the return value in a new variable
- In the iterateCount method add a line that prints the result to the console with the message ""Multiplied [integer] by [muliplie] to be [multiplied]"" where the value returned by multiplied get printed inline

*Note: Multiplication is easy with integers. Programmers need to know what happens when you perform integer division.*

### Step 4: Create another calculation method (divide)
- Add a method called divided that takes an integer and returns and integer
- At the top of the class declare a global static integer called divisor and set it equal to 6
- In the divided method, return the integer divided by the global variable divisor
  - You can write it out fully, or you can use the operator shorthand
- In the iterateCount method add a line that calls divided and passes in the value returned by multiplied and prints the result to the console with the message ""Divided [multiplied] by [divisor] to be [divided]"" where the value returned by divided gets printed inline

*Note: Play with the values. Can you predict what the outcome will be when you divide 16 by 6?*

### Step 5: Get floating-point answers
- The goal is to get ""Divided [integer] to be [divided]"" such that divided is a floating point value rather than a rounded integer. For example, 16 / 6 = 2.6666667. When iterateCount prints divided it should be a floating point value. The others should not.
- Go back through the multiplied and divided methods and update them so that the iterateCount method can print a floating point answer.

### Completion
- You should have a printed series of results that show floating point values for the divided answer as you would expect from a calculator.
- Feel free to play with the divisor and multiple and see what gets printed.
- You should be very comfortable knowing the result of integer division and how to get float results.

## Installing

1. First you'll need LaTeX. Instructions on obtaining it can be found here:
   http://latex-project.org/ftp.html
2. Compiling from the command line will look like the following:

   ```bash
   $ latexmk homework.tex
   ```
3. Or you can use [TeXShop][texshop] or a similar native client to typeset the
   LaTeX file.

## Credit

When first starting with LaTeX, I came across [this template][credit] and used
it as a base for starting my template. As you can see, it is pretty similar.

This repository is meant to provide an example for *forking* a repository on GitHub.

Creating a *fork* is producing a personal copy of someone else's project. Forks act as a sort of bridge between the original repository and your personal copy. You can submit *Pull Requests* to help make other people's projects better by offering your changes up to the original project. Forking is at the core of social coding at GitHub.

After forking this repository, you can make some changes to the project, and submit [a Pull Request](https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife/pulls) as practice.

For some more information on how to fork a repository, [check out our guide, ""Forking Projects""""](http://guides.github.com/overviews/forking/). Thanks! :sparkling_heart:

Create, edit and (optionally) display a journal article, entirely in GitHub.

In contrast to the more traditional process of `submit > peer review > publish` at [PeerJ](https://peerj.com), or even the less formal preprints at _PeerJ Preprints_ or _arXiv_, _Paper Now_ is an experiment to see where the future may go with scholarly communication. Initially, it may be that co-authors collaborate either privately or publicly on GitHub and then proceed to submitting to PeerJ or other journals for formal peer-review or preprinting. Or perhaps this is where the traditional medium of publication begins to diverge. There is no end goal other than to see what the academic community wants, which is why this is completely open to fork, extend, and build upon.

## Examples

* [Searching for anthrax in the New York City subway metagenome](https://read-lab-confederation.github.io/nyc-subway-anthrax-study/)
* [Collapse of the world's largest herbivores](http://git.macropus.org/collapse-largest-herbivores/)
* [Evidence for embodied predictive coding: the anterior insula coordinates cortical processing of tactile deviancy](http://git.macropus.org/allen-insula/)
* [Capsules of the diatom _Achnanthidium minutissimum_ arise from fibrillar precursors and foster attachment of bacteria](https://katrinleinweber.github.io/paper-now/)
* [Paper Now example article](https://peerj.github.io/paper-now/)

## Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your own account, by visiting [GitHub's importer](https://import.github.com/new/?import_url=https://github.com/peerj/paper-now/).
1. [Edit the article metadata](_data/article.yml)
1. Add [data](data) and [figures](_figures) by [uploading files to GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository/).
1. [Edit each section](_sections)
1. [View your article](https://peerj.github.io/paper-now/) in GitHub Pages at https://{username}.github.io/paper-now

## Notes

* Paper Now is at a very experimental stage; it may progress further if people find it useful.
* Paper Now is inspired by [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now); the sidebar layout is inspired by [Lens](https://github.com/elifesciences/lens).
* If you rename your repository, you also need to change the `baseurl` setting in [_config.yml](_config.yml) to match.
* [GitHub's desktop client](https://guides.github.com/introduction/getting-your-project-on-github/#desktop) is probably the easiest way to clone a repository, add/edit files and push the changes back to GitHub.
* The article styles and scripts are in [a separate web component](https://github.com/PeerJ/research-article), so can be updated independently of the article content.

## Feedback

* Does this article structure make sense? Would it be better all in one file? [Create an issue](https://github.com/peerj/paper-now/issues) to discuss it.

Fix for keyboard/mouse/tablet being detected as joystick in Linux.

There are several devices that, although recognized by kernel as joysticks, are not joysticks. This repository contains rules that will prevent the non-functional `/dev/input/js*` and `/dev/input/event*` devices from being used, by removing read/write permissions from them.

This is just a blacklist, which will always be incomplete (until the actual bug gets fixed). Feel free to add more devices to this list.

## How to install

### Version that changes permissions to 0000

    sudo curl -o /etc/udev/rules.d/51-these-are-not-joysticks.rules \
      https://raw.githubusercontent.com/denilsonsa/udev-joystick-blacklist/master/51-these-are-not-joysticks.rules

### Version that removes the device

    sudo curl -o /etc/udev/rules.d/51-these-are-not-joysticks-rm.rules \
      https://raw.githubusercontent.com/denilsonsa/udev-joystick-blacklist/master/51-these-are-not-joysticks-rm.rules

### Which version should I use?

Personally, I'd try the first version (that sets permissions to `0000`) first. If it does not work or if it gives trouble for some reason, I'd try the second version (that removes the device).

The first version (that sets permissions to `0000`) seems to work fine across several distros, but some distros ([such as OSMC](https://github.com/denilsonsa/udev-joystick-blacklist/issues/5#issuecomment-151872841)) may have additional rules that end up setting the permssions back to another value. In such case, the second version (that removes the device) should work.

In the end, it's up to you, and it's about what works best for you and your system.

## How it works

### Matching

A rule will match if:

* The subsystem is `input`;
* The pair `idVendor` and `idProduct` is in this list;
* Either one of:
    * The device property `ID_INPUT_JOYSTICK` is set;
    * Or the device name matches `js[0-9]*`.

### Actions

The following actions are taken on each matching rule:

* Clears `ID_INPUT_JOYSTICK` property, which prevents [some `/lib/udev/rules.d/*` rules from running](https://github.com/denilsonsa/udev-joystick-blacklist/issues/5#issuecomment-151832071).
* Depending on which version you installed:
    * [Removes read and write permissions by setting `MODE=""0000""`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system_permissions#Numeric_notation). This effectively prevents the device from being used.
    * Removes the device file from `/dev/input/`. This also prevents the device from being found or from being listed.

It is not possible to rename a device, so `NAME=""not-a-joystick%n""` will not work.

### Learning more about udev rules

* Documentation: <http://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/udev.html> (and also the manpages installed on your system).
* Debugging udev rules: <http://www.jpichon.net/blog/2011/12/debugging-udev-rules/>.
* Nice (but outdated) udev tutorial: <http://www.reactivated.net/writing_udev_rules.html>.

## Troubleshooting

Look at the generated `/dev` files: `ls -l /dev/input/`

Unplug and plug your USB device while monitoring for kernel and udev events: `udevadm monitor -p`

Look for other udev rules that may interact with the same device: `grep -i '\bjs\b\|joystick' /lib/udev/rules.d/* /etc/udev/rules.d/*`

## Contributing

The best ways to contribute are by [creating a new issue][issues] or by [making a pull request][forking]. Make sure you mention the device name/description and the vendor/product IDs. The relevant line from `lsusb` output is usually enough.

This repository contains a list of devices compiled from contributions of several people. I cannot test every single device. If something does not work for you even after you have added the correct rules, please try debugging it on your own system. The output of `udevadm monitor -p` may prove very helpful. Also look at the output of `ls -l /dev/input/`.

## History of this repository

After suffering with this issue for a long time, I decided to investigate possible fixes and workarounds. Then, in May 2015, after searching a lot for a solution, I've managed to create some udev rules that fixed the issue for my devices and decided to share this solution with other people. Initially, I shared [the simple file at GitHub Gist][gist]. Over time, people submitted contributions through comments, and keeping that file on Gist was becoming too hard to manage.

In October 2015, I decided to move the file to [this GitHub repository][github]. That way, it will be easier to make changes, to fork, to receive notifications, and essentially to maintain it.

Ideally, the bug in the Linux kernel should be fixed, so that this repository (which is essentially just a workaround) wouldn't be needed anymore.

A collection of scripts for working with genomic data.

**align2fastas.pl** - Reads in a fasta file with multiple sequences, creates a new directory and populates that directory with fasta files that each have only one sequence in them.  The number of resulting files is equal to the number of sequences in the original fasta file.

**fasta2nuccomp.pl**  - Reads in a fasta file, such as a genome, calculates length, A/T content, G/C content, N content, IUPAC polymorphic content (non A,C,G,T or N) as well as other nucleotides (nucleotides not included in the previous categories).  This information is written to a text file (comma delimited, with header) which is then read into R for plotting.  If you do not have R installed the plotting step will fail.  But you can read the text file into your favarite plotting package and use it as you wish.

Your dotfiles are how you personalize your system. These are mine.

## Install

### Main
```
curl --silent https://raw.github.com/ButuzGOL/dotfiles/master/install.sh | sh
```

### OSX configs
```
sudo bash .osx
```

### Bootstrap new system
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/ButuzGOL/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
bash bootstap.sh
```

## Structure
* `git` — git config files
* `sublime` — sublime config files
* `zsh` — zsh config files also themes
* `.` - other configs (.aliases, .bashrc, .gemrc, etc)

Formulas to set up and configure the ntp client or server.

.. note::

    See the full `Salt Formulas installation and usage instructions
    <http://docs.saltstack.com/topics/development/conventions/formulas.html>`_.

Available states
================

.. contents::
    :local:

``ntp``
-------

Installs the ntp package, and optionally, a basic config.

``ntp.server``
--------------

Installs the ntp server, an optional server config, and starts the ntp server.

``ntp.local_server``
--------------------

This forumula uses pillar data to determine if the server is an internal NTP
server or a local server that syncs to the internal NTP server and will write
the ntp.conf file accordingly.

Requires CentOS 5.X or CentOS 6.X.

``ntp.ng``
----------

This state is a re-implementation of the original NTP formula. As a state, ``ntp.ng`` controls both the client and server through pillar parameters. This formula does not require that a configuration file be served directly and instead fully exposes all ntp configuration parameters as set in the pillar.

**Note:** ``ntp.ng`` relies upon some conventions first available in the *Helium* release.

Elbowpatched Boilerplate is a template to make it easier to create an academic personal website.
It is built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), a simple, blog-aware, static site generator.
Since this template is built on Jekyll, 
you can publish your website on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for free.

* Source: [https://github.com/ianli/elbowpatched-boilerplate](https://github.com/ianli/elbowpatched-boilerplate)

## Why?

As a scholar, having an academic personal website can be a good way for you to publicize your research.
Your website can have descriptions of your research projects, 
a list of your published papers, 
and links to your slides and video presentations.

However, creating an academic personal website takes a lot of time.
Time that you also have to spend reading papers, conducting studies, analyzing data, and writing papers.

Elbowpatched Boilerplate is here to help!
It has the following features that make it easier to create an academic personal website.

* Fill out simple files with information about yourself, your publications, projects, and presentations.
* Use the provided templates or create your own to change the presentation of your content.
* Publish your website on GitHub Pages for free.


## Quick start

* Clone the git repo - `git clone https://github.com/ianli/elbowpatched-boilerplate.git`.
* Setup and run [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).
* Edit the contents of the [YAML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) files in the folder `_data`.
  * `personal.yml` - Your personal information
  * `publications.yml` - Bibliography of your publications
  * `projects.yml` - Descriptions of your projects with pictures
  * `presentations.yml` - Your presentations with links to slides
* Preview your website at `index.html`


## Layouts

Elbowpatched Boilerplate currently only has one template that you can use: 
[Albertine](https://github.com/ianli/elbowpatched-boilerplate/blob/gh-pages/_layouts/albertine.html).
Feel free to modify it to your needs.
I will add more layouts as this project progresses.

If you want to create a new template, take a look at 
[Albertine](https://github.com/ianli/elbowpatched-boilerplate/blob/gh-pages/_layouts/albertine.html) 
for inspiration. 
The [Templates documentation](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/templates/) on the Jekyll site and
[Liquid Basics](http://docs.shopify.com/themes/liquid-documentation/basics) 
are good introductions to Liquid, the template language of Jekyll.


## Publishing options

When you're ready to publish your website, you have two options:

1. Publish on GitHub Pages - [instructions](https://pages.github.com/).
2. Publish on your own webserver - [instructions](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/deployment-methods/).

Catalog of Open Source Software from NASA. Built using [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org).

## Setup

### Prerequisites

Install bower and [polymer-cli](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-cli):

    npm install -g bower polymer-cli

### Install dependencies

    bower i

### Start the development server

This command serves the app at `http://localhost:8080` and provides basic URL
routing for the app:

    polymer serve --open


### Build

This command performs HTML, CSS, and JS minification on the application
dependencies, and generates a service-worker.js file with code to pre-cache the
dependencies based on the entrypoint and fragments specified in `polymer.json`.
The minified files are output to the `build/unbundled` folder, and are suitable
for serving from a HTTP/2+Push compatible server.

In addition the command also creates a fallback `build/bundled` folder,
generated using fragment bundling, suitable for serving from non
H2/push-compatible servers or to clients that do not support H2/Push.

    polymer build

### Preview the build

This command serves the minified version of the app at `http://localhost:8080`
in an unbundled state, as it would be served by a push-compatible server:

    polymer serve build/unbundled

This command serves the minified version of the app at `http://localhost:8080`
generated using fragment bundling:

    polymer serve build/bundled
    
### Deploying

When deploying to a static web server (with no HTTP/2+Push), be sure to copy
the files from `build/bundled` (**NOT** the project directory) which
contains a functional service worker and minified files.

### Adding a new view

You can extend the app by adding more views that will be demand-loaded
e.g. based on the route, or to progressively render non-critical sections
of the application.  Each new demand-loaded fragment should be added to the
list of `fragments` in the included `polymer.json` file.  This will ensure
those components and their dependencies are added to the list of pre-cached
components (and will have bundles created in the fallback `bundled` build).

Since the beginning of the Data Science Specialization we've noticed the unbelievable passion students have about our courses and the generosity they show toward each other on the course forums. A couple students have created quality content around the subjects we discuss, and many of these materials are so good we feel that they should be shared with all of our students. This site is meant to serve as a central directory for community created content.

This is the github.io source code page for [azure.github.io](http://azure.github.io). Please feel free to fork and
submit a pull request if you want to correct or add some content.

Cheers!

## Get Started

- Install Ruby and the Ruby DevKit on your system of choice.

    **Note** If you're running Ruby on a Windows machine, make sure your DevKit path variables are setup using the Dev Kit [quickstart instructions](https://github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller/wiki/development-kit#quick-start).
- Install Node/NPM
- Run `bundle install` from the root of the project. Note: If you do not have Bundler installed, run `gem install bundler` beforehand.
- Run `npm install` from the root of the project.
- Run `npm install gulp -g`

## Usage

- To build the site, run `gulp`.
- If you would like to see draft posts, you need to add `--drafts` [gulpfile.js](./gulpfile.js) line 73
  - TODO: automatically show drafts locally

## Authoring a Blog posts

To create a new post, check out https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/. After reading the aforementioned link, you
will have a better understanding of how to create a post, but not the FrontMatter yaml supported by default. 
We support the following FrontMatter yaml by default:

- title: is the title of the post and shown as the large header for the post
- subtitle: is the subtitle of the post and shown as subtext to the main header
- tags: an array of categories for the post. Each tag produces an index of tagged pages
- bigimg: an array of images which will rotate behind the title of the post
- comments: allow disqus comments on the post

### Sample FrontMatter

```yaml
title: Deploying a Resource Manager Template
subtitle: Building infrastructure with Ruby on Azure
tags:
  - Ruby
  - IaaS
bigimg:
  - /images/hero-partners.png
  - https://udemy-images.udemy.com/course/750x422/8082_e627_11.jpg
  - https://images7.alphacoders.com/679/thumb-1920-679140.png
comments: true
```

### Sample Draft

You can find a sample draft in the [_drafts](./_drafts) folder.

### Ready to Post?

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/emberjs/website.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/emberjs/website)

The website for the Ember.js project.

### Contributing

To get started:

``` sh
git clone https://github.com/emberjs/website.git
cd website
bundle
bundle exec middleman
```

Then visit [http://localhost:4567/](http://localhost:4567/)

**Note**: unless you're working with the API docs, don't use `rake preview`—use `middleman` (aka `middleman server`) instead.

To populate organizers data from meetup.com on [http://localhost:4567/meetups](http://localhost:4567/meetups)

  * get a [meetup API Key](https://secure.meetup.com/meetup_api/key/)
  * set `ENV[""MEETUP_API_KEY""]`
  * run the following rake command

``` sh
rake findorganizers [force=true]

The force=true flag will overwrite all existing organizer data
```

#### API Documentation

You can preview the API documentation by generating the docs from the source code. To begin, ensure
that you have the necessary dependencies:

- Node
- npm
- Ruby
- bundler

Next, clone the three repositories: [`ember.js`](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js),
[`data`](https://github.com/emberjs/data), and this repository, `website`. The repositories need
to be placed in the same directory:

    emberjs/
        website/
        ember.js/
        ember-data/

Note that the name of the data project needs to be `ember-data`, not `data`.

Next, navigate into the root directory of this repository and execute `bundle exec rake generate_docs`. This
will build the documentation for the `ember.js` and `data` repositories.

You can launch the website via `bundle exec middleman` to preview the generated docs.

### Requirements

If the `bundle` command is not found, you can install it with `gem install bundle`.

If the `bundle` command fails to run, you may need to upgrade your Ruby version. The Ember.js website build requires 1.9.3 or newer (2.0.0 recommended). You can use [RVM](https://rvm.io/) to install it:

``` sh
curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable
rvm install 2.0.0
rvm use 2.0.0
```

### Troubleshooting tips for Windows devs

For Windows developers using [RubyInstaller](http://rubyinstaller.org/), you'll need to [download the DevKit](http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads) and install it using instructions:
https://github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller/wiki/Development-Kit

After you have a proper install, you can then run:
``` sh
gem install bundler wdm tzinfo-data
gem update listen middleman
```

Once Middleman comes up, you'll be prompted by Windows Firewall. Click ""Allow access"" and you'll be in business!

==================================================================================================================

This repository contains the files used for generating the [Mono website](http://www.mono-project.com).

The site uses [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), a static site generator. GitHub Pages, where the site is hosted, natively supports Jekyll so every time someone pushes to this repository, the website will be built and updated. For hosting it yourself, see [Setting up a local copy of the website](#setting-up-a-local-copy-of-the-website).

Contributing to the website
---------------------------

**Note:** Major issues or feature requests should be filed on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/mono/website/issues) first, so we can discuss the implications.

If you want to edit a page, the easiest way is to click the ![Edit page on GitHub](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1376924/3712375/a6d7bc42-150f-11e4-9ceb-5230cbbfba3f.png) link under the page title on the website.

This will open the source file on GitHub where you can click the pencil button to start editing:
![Arrow to pencil](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1376924/3712474/1d2fe57a-1517-11e4-86b2-d083dbeaa4ae.png)

GitHub's editor shows you both the [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) source as well as a preview of the rendered page:

After you've finished your changes, enter a proper summary and description and click the ""Propose file change"" button to open a pull request:
![Propose file change](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1376924/3712481/52423448-1517-11e4-8aa8-9c9f9befb6bc.png)

Setting up a local copy of the website
--------------------------------------

For larger changes, using the web-based editor on GitHub is not really convenient. A better way is to setup a local copy of the website where you can experiment.

### Dependencies

 - [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) - Jekyll is written in Ruby
 - [Bundler](http://bundler.io/) - a package manager for Ruby. Install it by running `gem install bundler`

After you've forked and cloned the repository, run the following commands:
 1. `bundle install` - downloads the required libraries
 2. `bundle exec jekyll serve` - builds the website and runs a local webserver on port 4000

**Note:** you can add the `--watch` option when running `jekyll serve` to let Jekyll watch for file changes, which means the site will be rebuilt when a file is modified.

**Note 2:** on case-insensitive file systems like on Windows and Mac OS X you'll run into redirect loops for some URLs. The workaround is to disable redirects locally by removing the `gems: jekyll-redirect-from` entry from `_config.yml`.

The site should now be running locally:
![website](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1376924/3712425/c1ab2e9c-1513-11e4-9df2-6e69d461c3cf.png)

Repository structure
--------------------

 - `_includes` - *special folder* contains snippets that can be included via `{% include file.html %}` in other pages
 - `_layouts` - *special folder* contains the layouts that are shared between pages. Layouts can be inherited, the root layout is `base.html`.
 - `_posts` - *special folder*, contains the source pages for the blog section, see [Writing a blog post](#writing-a-blog-post)
 - `_site` - the output of the generated site is stored here by default, this folder only exists after Jekyll built the site
 - `archived` - content that is no longer relevant but kept to keep external links working
 - `community` - contains the source pages for the `/community` website section
 - `css` - contains the main stylesheet
 - `docs` - contains the source pages for the `/docs` website section
 - `download` - contains the source pages for the `/download` website section
 - `files` - stores binary files used in pages
 - `images` - stores the images used in pages
 - `news` - lists the blog pages from the `_posts` directory

Writing a blog post
-------------------

Blogging is very easy with Jekyll. Simply add a new Markdown file to the `_posts` folder following the file name convention: `YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.md`

Make sure to not include special characters in the file name. The blog entry's publishing date is automatically extracted from the file name.

Installation
------------

Drop this skeleton app into your document root somewhere. You need to run the composer library to obtain the vendor dependencies that PPI requires.

``` bash
curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php
php composer.phar install
```

Ideally you'll want to set up a vhost on your httpd web server to point your domain to the /public/ folder of your PPI skeleton app, but for now you're still able to browse to http://localhost/skeletonapp/public/

This repository contains [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) templates, CSS styles and images for the [Fedora Developer Portal](https://developer.fedoraproject.org/).

Please submit your **ideas**, **bug reports** or **requests** regarding:
- content of the portal in our [content repository issue tracker](https://github.com/developer-portal/content/issues).
- the project, our processes or the portal itself on our [website repository issue tracker](https://github.com/developer-portal/website/issues).

## Implementation

The whole site is generated with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) as a static site with some dynamic parts. Site search functionality is implemented in JavaScript and the index is pre-generated during the Jekyll build.

There is an `rss.py` script that replaces the blog posts section on the index page in the generated `_site/` from the Fedora Planet.

## Development

We use [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) to generate the site, `setup.sh` script to install development dependencies (on Fedora) and we also provide [Vagrantfile](/Vagrantfile) and [Dockerfile](/Dockerfile)
to spin up the whole development environment. [content](https://github.com/developer-portal/content) repository is a git submodule.

See our [development guide](/DEVELOPMENT.md) on how to run the site locally for development.

To build the site run `jekyll build` or `jekyll serve`. You need to install [dependencies](/setup.sh) first.

## Tests

We have some basic Capybara/Webkit test specifications that can help you to notice if something broke. They will also check all internal links between pages so you should also run them to test changes in `content` repository.

To execute the test suite run `rspec spec`. You need to install [dependencies](/setup.sh) first and the site has to be already generated and available in `_site/` folder.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! You can find us on `freenode` under `#developer-portal` if you have any further questions.

The site is generates static content from Markdown articles, using software
called [Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.5.0/).

These docs are aimed at a Debian-based Linux user.

## Installation ##

### `git` ###

`git` is the source control that we use to manage changes to the website. It
comes preinstalled on most Linux systems. If you don't already have it, just
run

```
sudo apt-get install git-core
```

For more information about what a typical `git` workflow for contributing to
the site might look like, check out [the curriculum from the WiCS git
workshop](https://github.com/wics-uw/git-workshop-W16/wiki) and [this OpenHatch
document](http://openhatch.readthedocs.org/en/latest/advanced/working_with_git.html).
You can also look into completing the [OpenHatch `git` training
mission](http://openhatch.org/missions/git).

### `pelican` ###

The easiest way to install Pelican is to create a `virtualenv`. To do so,
first ensure that `virtualenv` is installed:

```
sudo apt-get install python-virtualenv
```

Now you can create a `virtualenv`:

```
mkdir -p ~/virtualenvs/pelican
cd ~/virtualenvs/pelican
virtualenv .
source bin/activate
```

Your shell prompt will change slightly, like this:

```
user@honk ~/virtualenvs/pelican $ source bin/activate
(pelican)user@honk ~/virtualenvs/pelican $
```

Now you can install Pelican by typing

```
pip install pelican markdown
```

If you ever need to re-enable the `virtualenv`, simply run

```
source ~/virtualenvs/pelican/bin/activate
```

## Setup ##

Before you get started with development, we're going to walk through some setup
steps.

### Cloning your repository ###

Only complete this step once!

You'll need to fork a copy of this repo in order to contribute. To do so, click
the ""Fork"" button in the upper right hand corner.

One the project is forked, you'll be taken to your very own local copy of the
WiCS website, perhaps at `https://github.com/<your-username>/website`. This is
your personal remote repository on GitHub, or what we'll call `origin`.

Next, you'll need a folder to store the code in. On Linux, use the command line
to create a new directory and navigate there (`mkdir /path/to/code` and `cd
/path/to/code`). On Windows, you can make a folder in Windows Explorer, and
since you have git installed, right click and select ""Open Git Bash Here"" to
launch a terminal.

Now you can clone your code:

```
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/website.git
```

which will create a folder called `website`. This is your git repository! In
both git bash or your Linux terminal, `cd website`.

Now we need to add a reference to our upstream remote repository:

```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/wics-uw/website.git
```

## Contributing content to the website ##

### Creating a feature branch ###

In git, when we are working on a feature, we usually split it off from the
master branch and refer to this branch as a ""feature branch"" or ""topic branch.""

If you're ready to work on a topic branch, follow these easy steps. First,
ensure your master branch is up to date:

```
git checkout master         # Check out your master branch
git fetch upstream          # Fetch any new upstream code
git rebase upstream/master  # Rebase your master branch to match upstream
git push origin master      # Update your remote `origin` repository
```

Now you can make a new topic branch off master:

```
git checkout -b topic-name  # Equivalent to git branch topic-name then checkout
```

### Commit structure ###

Here are some tips for structuring your commits. These are generally considered
best practices.

+ Use present-tense, imperative commit messages.
  + **DON'T** write ""This fixes issue #234 by optimizing the algorithm""
  + **DO** write ""Optimizes algorithm; fixes #234""
+ Write descriptive commit messages that give the reviewer the big picture
  + **DON'T** write ""Updates in css files""; this is redundant and can be
    determined by viewing the files the patch modifies
  + **DO** feel free to write multi-line commit messages; keep in mind that
    while only the first line is visible in summary view, additional comments
    below go into the git log and can be very useful
+ Separate commits in the smallest logical, reversible steps possible.
  + **DON'T** submit multiple small commits fixing typos; rebase these into a
    single commit
  + **DO** include whitespace updates in a separate commit from code changes,
    template changes separate from adding content, etc.
+ Ask for help if you're not sure how to do some of these things!

Remember: code reviews will help catch these things and give you a better idea
of what's considered standard. Don't fear constructive feedback!

### Seeing what your change looks like ###

Before submitting a pull request, you can test your change locally to see what
it will look like on the website. If you don't want to [test
locally](#testing-locally) or are having trouble setting it up, you can also
just submit a pull request and wait for someone to deploy a [Heroku Review
App](#heroku-review-apps)

### Submitting pull requests ###

After you've made your modifications on your topic branch, perhaps following
the guide in the **Development** section, you can now ask for your code to be
merged by submitting a pull request.

To do so, first push your code to your personal remote, `origin`:

```
git push origin topic-name
```

Then log onto GitHub. You'll find a big green button asking if you want to
submit a pull request. Click it and follow the steps to submit your pull
request.

Once it's merged, you can click the ""Delete branch"" button on GitHub. In your
local repository, the branch can be deleted with the

```
git branch -d topic-name
```

command.

### Reviewing a pull request ###

There are three views for reviewing a pull request on GitHub: **Conversation**,
**Commits**, and **Files changed**.

**Conversation**

- Comments on the pull request show up here, including any inline comments that
  are added when viewing the file diffs. A summary of submitted commits is also
  listed.
- Use this section to submit general feedback about the pull request.

**Commits**

- A more detailed list of commits included in the pull request, that will allow
  a reviewer to view each individually.
- Usually before merging, you'll want all the commits from that change to be
  squashed into a single commit. Some of the reasons for this is so that the
  commit can show the whole change that was made, and so that there aren't a
  bunch of typo fixes in the repository's commit history!

**Files changed**

- The `diff` view of the pull request. Lets the reviewer see the full patch in
  its entirety, and add inline comments on changes.
- Use this section to submit line-specific feedback.

#### Giving feedback ####

Everyone is invited to give feedback regardless of experience. Comments can
touch on:

- phrasing of any text added (typos, awkward phrasing, using gendered language
  where it could be gender neutral)
- tags on event posts (do they make sense? are they existing tags?)
- lines that are over 80 characters long (which we avoid except for certain
  cases like the metadata at the top of many of the files)
- any identation that's hard to read 
- the way the change looks on the [Heroku Review App](#heroku-review-apps)
- if there are multiple commmits that can be [squashed into one
  commit](#squashing-commits)
- linking to the site with a [static urls instead of relative 
  urls](https://github.com/wics-uw/website/issues/222) (which generally [is bad
  practice](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2005079/))

You can even look at it and decide it looks good and just comment with “looks
good to me!” 


### Squashing commits ###

If you have `x` commits you want to squash into one, run

```git rebase -i HEAD~x```

- you'll see a list of the last `x` commits.
- keep the first one as `pick`
- choose `fixup` (or you can just type `f`) for the rest of the commits
- save and close, and there should just be one commit there! (to confirm, you
  can run `git log`)

When you push the new squashed commit, `git` will be confused and think you're
missing those `x` commits (when really you just turned them all into a new
single commit). You might see the error message failed to push some refs to
`https://github.com/<some-path>` and a suggestion to run `git pull`. **Do not
ever run `git pull`**. It will bring back in a copy of all the commits you
squashed and potentially other commits unrelated to your change. Instead run
`git push --force`.

### Pulling in changes ###

Maybe while you were working on your change, someone else contributed updates
to the repository and you want add them to your branch. **Do not ever run `git
pull`**. Instead run:

```
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/master
git push -f origin HEAD
```

If you can't fetch from upstream, you might have to add a reference to our
upstream remote repo:

```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/wics-uw/website.git
```

### Merging ###

A back-and-forth revision process will occur during the course of the review.
For the developer to update the pull request, they simply need to push new
changes to the topic branch being considered (sometimes using a force-push if
they need to rewrite commits).

When all parties are happy with the patch, the reviewer can then sign off and
merge the code by clicking the big green ""Merge"" button. This code is then
merged into the upstream master branch. For the changes to appear on the
website, someone needs to deploy the new code (see the **Deployment** section
for more details).

## Development ##

You can either add content to the site or modify its theme.

### Adding site content ###

All site content is contained in the `content/` directory. Posts are sorted by
term directories, e.g. ""F2014"". There is also a `pages/` directory that
contains non-post type pages, such as contact info, about us, etc.

#### Posts ####

We currently use three posting categories: **Blog**, **Events**, and **Media**.

+ Use the **Media** category for video recordings of talks and events.
+ Use the **Events** category to advertise event details.
+ Use the **Blog** category for everything else: news, essays, etc.

You can also tag posts! Try to use tags that have already been used on the
other posts, but feel free to add new tags as necessary.

Please try to use a consistent naming scheme. Articles are named by term,
category, and slug; for instance, posting a video of a talk about automata in
S13 might be named `S13-media-automata.md`.

#### Pages ####

We only need a limited number of pages. You probably won't need to add many
more. These include things like our Code of Conduct, contact info, etc.

It might be useful to add a page that doesn't show up in the site navigation.
To do so, make sure you set `Status: hidden` in the Markdown preamble. This
will cause the page to be generated without showing up in the site's main
navigation.

### Markup beautification ###

The theme we are currently using is called `notmyidea`. Pelican uses the
[jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/dev/) templating system; if you've used
Django, you'll find the templates very similar.

To modify the theme css or html, simply take a look at the theme data under
`theme/notmyidea/` and modify it at will.

### Testing Locally ###

To test a local copy of the site, you'll need to start the development server.
There's no additional software you need to install to launch a local version of
the site! Simply run

```
./develop_server.sh start
```

in the top directory, which will launch the development server on port 8000.
Then you can navigate to the local site by visiting http://localhost:8000 in
your browser. This script will conveniently regenerate the site every time you
make a change to a file, so you won't need to rerun this command.

To shut down the development server, use

```
./develop_server stop
```

## Heroku Review Apps ##

When prompted, Heroku will provision temporary public web hosting and a domain
name for any open pull request, and post a pingback on GitHub. This allows
anyone to access the temporary site and review what our website would look
like upon merging the changes from that pull request.

### Permissions to access Heroku

Access to Heroku is granted to all committers in the wics-uw GitHub
organization. Membership to the ""committers"" group is granted to all full
Systems Committee members, as well as individuals that the Systems Committee
have chosen in recognition of their contributions and demonstrated
responsibility and good judgment.

To become a committer, you'll need to learn git, contribute regularly to the
WiCS website (both opening pull requests and reviewing them), and then ask the
Systems Committee for access, by emailing <wics-sys@lists.uwaterloo.ca>.

### To deploy a pull request

1. Go to [https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps)
2. Click on *wics-site*
3. In the left column, named *Review Apps*, find the PR you want to deploy and
   click the button that says *Create Review App*

## Deployment ##

We are currently using the [Computer Science
Club](https://csclub.uwaterloo.ca)'s [""club
hosting""](http://wiki.csclub.uwaterloo.ca/Club_Hosting) as our webhost. You
must have a CSC login in the `wics` group to complete the next steps.

To deploy the site, first log into the CSC's webserver:

```
ssh userid@csclub.uwaterloo.ca
```

Then use `become_club` to switch to the WiCS user account:

```
become_club wics
```

Pull the latest version of the site from GitHub:

```
cd ~/pelican
git pull
```

Then build and deploy the site:

```
source ~/virtualenvs/pelican/bin/activate
make rsync_upload
```

Which conveniently deploys the site into the `wics` user's `www/` directory.

The site is hosted at [devopsbootcamp.osuosl.org][DOBC.O.O]. 

This repository has a post-commit hook set up to update the main site every
time the master branch is changed. If the site doesn't update within a couple
of minutes, the build may have failed. Check that `make html` doesn't throw
any errors in your copy of the repo, and ask someone with admin access on
readthedocs to investigate what it reports is broken.

## Viewing Slides: 

Slides are available on [slides.osuosl.org][SLIDES.O.O/DOBC], and rebuild
automatically whenever new content is pushed to the master branch of this
repo.

The script in scripts/build.sh automatically removes the slides that were built
of non-slides content, based on the assumption that the filenames of all actual 
slides start with the week number.   

You can also build the slides locally if you've been editing them and want to
see how they'll look before you push, or if you don't have push access to the
project: 

```
$ sudo pip install virtualenv
$ git clone https://github.com/DevOpsBootcamp/website.git
$ cd website
$ virtualenv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate # enter the virtual environment
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

# output lives in build/ and the stuff you want to edit is in source/
# images and things go in source/static/

$ make slides # slides will go to build/slides
$ make html # to preview roughly how it'll look on readthedocs

$ deactivate # leave the virtual environment
```

The `src` contains the sources for the files,
they are rendered to fill-in the blanks for the templates
and the output is placed into `www`.

There are various support scripts for processing the data sources
and a `makefile` to help working with it.

Getting Started
---------------

Make sure to not only clone from here or your fork,
but also to initialize all
[submodules](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Submodules).

    git clone --recursive git@github.com:sagemath/website.git

or if you forgot the `--recursive` switch, do this:

    git submodule update --init --recursive

Later, don't forget to not only update the `website` project,
but also the submodules
(or whatever it is the right thing to do).
For example:

    git submodule foreach ""git checkout master; git pull origin master""

### Ubuntu Packages

To get started on Ubuntu:

    sudo apt-get install -y pybtex python-jinja2 python-markdown python-yaml

Development
-----------

The websites needs various data-sources to build its pages.
For example, the publications pages use HTML snippets
generated by the `publications` submodule.

Ideally, a courageous `make` should do everything for you
and and additional `make open` opens up your web-browser
to inspect the result.

To test the website under realistic conditions,
`make server` starts a minimal HTTP server on port 8181 and
`make show` opens it in your web-browser.

### NQ8 Images

Shrinking PNG images further down via e.g.

    pngnq -v -f -s 64 index_icons.png


### Continuous Build Mode

For your convenience, there is a continuous build mode available: `make cont`

It depends on

* [pyInotify](https://github.com/seb-m/pyinotify) - `pip install --user pyinotify` -
  to pick up any changes in your local file-system.

* [xdotool](http://www.semicomplete.com/projects/xdotool/) - `apt-get install xdotool` -
  which does reload the open tab in your web-browser (by sending `Shift+Ctrl+R`).

Their combined effect is, that less than a second after you ""save"" a file,
you can see the result without lifting a finger.

Style
-----

* HTML: Modern HTML5, but nothing too fancy please.
  One of the main design goals is that everything should still work
  without Javascript and no Flash.

* Python: PEP8 is authoritative for various Python scripts -- except E501 (long lines).
  Just make sure your `pep8` and `autopep8` is up-to-date and
  do a healthy `make style` to clean up your code before you commit.

FOSDEM is the Free and Open source Software Developers' European Meeting,
an event that is organized by the community for the community, as a non-for-profit.

Thousands of Open Source contributors from around the world meet every year in Brussels (Belgium)
to enjoy over 400 sessions and many occasions to chat and exchange.

Our website uses the nanoc static site generator, and we did implement a lot of custom
code to support our workflow as painlessly as possible.
Maybe some bits of those will be an inspiration or of help.

These are the sources for http://prosemirror.net

This currently contains a [front-page](http://prosemirror.net), the
[demos](http://prosemirror.net/#demos) (including server-side code to
support the
[collaborative demo](http://prosemirror.net/demo/collab.html)), the
[guides](http://prosemirror.net/docs.html), and the scripts to build
the [reference docs](http://prosemirror.net/ref.html).

## Installation

Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org).

Install the module's dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Build the documentation and all the demos' JavaScript source

```bash
make
```

That will populate the `public/` directory with an instance of the
website. You could point a webserver at it to try it out.

To work on the demos, or to experiment with the collaborative demo, it
is a good idea to use the dev server:

```
npm run devserver -- --port 8888
```

That will get you a server at [localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888/)
that serves the files in `public/`, along with the collaborative
editing backend, and updates the demo pages to use
[moduleserve](https://github.com/marijnh/moduleserve) so that you can
run the demos directly from the source files, rather than using the
bundled code. You can now edit them and see the changes with a single
refresh. (Though the server-side collaborative code still needs a
server refresh to update.)

Note that this is not secure (it provides filesystem access of HTTP)
and not fast (the browser will fetch each module individually), and
should only be used for development, on your local machine, bound to
`localhost`.

Octopress is [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) blogging at its finest.

1. **Octopress sports a clean responsive theme** written in semantic HTML5, focused on readability and friendliness toward mobile devices.
2. **Code blogging is easy and beautiful.** Embed code (with [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) styling) in your posts from gists, jsFiddle or from your filesystem.
3. **Third party integration is simple** with built-in support for Pinboard, Delicious, GitHub Repositories, Disqus Comments and Google Analytics.
4. **It's easy to use.** A collection of rake tasks simplifies development and makes deploying a cinch.
5. **Ships with great plug-ins** some original and others from the Jekyll community &mdash; tested and improved.

## Contributing

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/imathis/octopress.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/imathis/octopress)

We love to see people contributing to Octopress, whether it's a bug report, feature suggestion or a pull request. At the moment, we try to keep the core slick and lean, focusing on basic blogging needs, so some of your suggestions might not find their way into Octopress. For those ideas, we started a [list of 3rd party plug-ins](https://github.com/imathis/octopress/wiki/3rd-party-plugins), where you can link your own Octopress plug-in repositories. For the future, we're thinking about ways to easier add them them into our main releases.
